record fails to lift lacklustre meet  yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham  and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record  apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets  so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish  it would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i havent seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests frances ronald pognon  who has run  seconds  will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet  something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the womens national m race in a new personal best of  seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong xm squad going to the european championships scotlands lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the m but i dont think the pacemaking was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the mens m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly ,1

 an irish athletics year   wont be remembered as one of irish athletics great years  the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad but come late august a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics  or to be more accurate the lack of it sonia osullivans olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers but after the disastrous buildup to the games we shouldnt have been surprised at the start of the year an osullivan had been earmarked as irelands best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury less than a week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo lombards shattering of mark carrolls national m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a twoyear ban from the sport  back at preolympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things couldnt have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens once the track and field action began in athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair craggs performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the m final did offer hope for the future our beloved sonia scraped into the womens k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shakeup as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the  hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a worldclass field at the flora lite k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over its unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition at least sonia managed to make it to athens at the start of the year several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an outofform and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of  and an early exit  james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane the injuryplagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the m qualifying mark but  was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckees athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in  pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injuryravaged years donnelly and his annadale striders teammates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on  december a large turnout of athleticsloving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andys many friends as only death can it put the years athletics happenings in a sharp perspective ,1
funding cut hits wales students  the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby unions reorganisation at youth level  an amalgamated under side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday against italy at the gnoll but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students as a result traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union reverend eldon phillips said it is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge that is representative rugby but this year that opportunity will be denied them players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones rob howley jon humphreys darren morris martyn williams and ceri sweeney ,1

time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the  minutes at the end  i would say its  whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarterfinals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first  minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole teams worth the debate will rage on and im not sure there is a satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you englands game against holland is a good example it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember svengoran erikssons side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed ,1
osullivan keeps his powder dry  when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential  ireland coach eddie osullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the runup to this seasons six nations championship he decreed after the  world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year that became a reality at the end of last summer with a week period at the start of the this season it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday but like osullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it the irfu has thrown their weight behind osullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrallycontrolled contracts bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg everyone of osullivans squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this seasons campaign  but i doubt whether osullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players he is not that sort of person however he may look at the overworked and injuryhit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season a first grand slam since karl mullens led the team to a clean sweep in  with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman  under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled take the triple crownwinning side of  under mick doyle they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam only the second in irelands history what happened in  whitewashed you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary it is the nature of the beast but osullivans side are very capable of proving a salient point this season after their first triple crown for  years they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder osullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades  and there is more to come he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this seasons championship with a different box of tricks and a new verve to succeed ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it ,1

wru proposes season overhaul  the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks  the season would start with the celtic league in october followed by the heineken cup in february and march and the six nations moved to april and may after a nine week break the wru then proposes a twomonth period of away and home international matches wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country he added we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed pickering added its very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it  not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important weve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits ,1

european medal chances improve  what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects  it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around  the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the m hurdles running subeight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a headtohead race will give sarah confidence in the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the mens m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid  phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him  but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency  and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and m hurdles and you cant ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what weve seen so far  she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasnt all good news in sheffield i thought both the m races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasnt at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him hes there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the womens race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker  janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a twoyear drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldnt be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them ,1

athens memories soar above lows  well its goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens  obviously theres no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but i want to remind you of a few more events that made  another year to remember  or forget  for athletics      one of my favourite olympic moments was kellys success in the m  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the m would be a bit of a formality kelly had been full of should i shouldnt i thoughts about going for the double in athens i thought why wouldnt you do the m its your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story      the victory for the british mens xm relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games i think the four of them  jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewisfrancis  knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake      hicham el guerroujs olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kellys on a global scale  he was the first man since for  years to win both the m and m titles as soon as he had added the m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good      what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the m five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day  things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing doesnt feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon  miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall the positive thing to take from paulas olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people  including me      purely as a race paulas victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nipandtuck between her and kenyas susan chepkemei and you dont usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out      kelly and the xm boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that were not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level  the only individual mens finalist on the track was michael east in the m i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and thats where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the m and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we dont have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesnt look good for the beijing olympics and beyond      i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special      to be honest im getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on  having said that im always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it ,1

hewitt survives nalbandian epic  home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic fiveset battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semifinals  hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a twoset lead but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the th game and served out to win      and set up a meeting with andy roddick the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets  the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitts exuberant oncourt celebrations were not very good for the sport and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip and he doublefaulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes i just kept hanging in there it was always tough serving second in the fifth set said hewitt who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again its a long way from holding that trophy up there but im hanging in there only four guys left that can win and were the top four in the world its set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals ,1

celts savour grand slam prospect  the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam playoff in three weeks time  but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french noone knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on  march  sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham but how the mighty have fallen england sat on rugbys summit  months ago as world champions and  grand slam winners but they have lost nine of their  matches since that heady night in sydney and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon playoff against italy in a fortnight  england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in  coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost a phalanx of world cup stars and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team the same year that england ruled the roost a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations and they won only two games against scotland and italy in  wales most recent championship title was in  and their last grand slam success came in  in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al  but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with a broken thumb accurate kicking from either flyhalf stephen jones or centre gavin henson a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams ireland coach eddie osullivan and captain brian odriscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearlymen tag that has dogged them for the past few years the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runnersup for the past two years to france and england  but they have not won the title since  and last clinched a grand slam in  as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the  wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in  italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in  coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials and so to france brilliant one minute inept the next but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on  march ,1
dallaglio his own man to the end  controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career  even the end of his nineyear career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in   rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in  it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three backrow positions at international standard  within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captains band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the  lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england teammate martin johnson he played a massive role in the  series victory but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in   first came the lastminute defeat to wales in which dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use  of which he was subsequently cleared  splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson as a member of a newlook england side on the long road to world cup glory  a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned  dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again  yet another setback arrived in  as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglios involvement on the lions tour to australia  rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre  the only player to play every minute of englands world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure englands historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnsons retirement dallaglios career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglios second spell as captain losing five of their eight postworld cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of englands most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country  the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglios role as captain but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the yearold although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no standout candidate speaks volumes about dallaglios massive influence on english rugby ,1

man city  man utd  manchester united reduced chelseas premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city  wayne rooney met gary nevilles cross to the near post with a low shot which went in via a deflection off richard dunne to put united ahead seven minutes later the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james head and into his own net steve mcmanaman wasted citys best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half in the opening  minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance  a paul scholes header over the bar and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern only shaun wrightphillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems  wes brown also found wrightphillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline wrightphillips sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pinpoint centre to the feet of mcmanaman but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by sidefooting the easy chance wide john oshea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some muchneeded pace into the united attack rooney was being well marshalled by dunne  but that was all about to change after the break united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of citys best firsthalf chance rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it  even if he needed the help of dunnes leg worse was to come for dunne who had been having a fine match on  minutes he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooneys cross and united seemed home and dry however city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post   manchester city boss kevin keegan we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much but we still had four good chances two after wed gone  down the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from    manchester united boss sir alex ferguson it wasnt our best performance of the last three months but i think were deserved winners at times especially in the first half we didnt play with enough speed but with cristiano ronaldo and ryan giggs on the speed improved derby games can be like that they can be scrappy dull horrible and it was maybe like that man city james mills bradley wrightphillips  dunne distin thatcher shaun wrightphillips barton macken  sibierski mcmanaman musampa fowler subs not used weaver onuoha flood booked fowler sibierski man utd carroll gary neville ferdinand brown heinze oshea ronaldo  keane fortune fletcher giggs  rooney scholes phil neville  subs not used howard bellion booked rooney scholes keane goals rooney  dunne  og att  ref s bennett kent ,1

benitez delight after crucial win  liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group  jorge andrades early own goal gave liverpool a  win and benitez said we started at a very high tempo and had many chances it is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack we are pleased but move on to the next game igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso and benitez said he played very well it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level benitez added it is all back in our own hands now it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen as far as my feelings about winning in spain that is really not important i want to see us win away matches in the champions league that it was in spain was not my first consideration as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in benitez added benitez said we had a problem before the start it was decided that xabi could not play more than  minutes but in the end because of the way that dietmar hamann and igor biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed but we knew that if we hit them on the counterattack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out deportivo coach javier irureta said liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down i know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination the goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it i know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that ,1
ireland win eclipses refereeing errors  the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go bellyup  it may have to go the whole way and have nflstyle video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself sundays explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since  the game was as exciting as it comes with a muchimproved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way one can understand that frustration there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their  victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sports blazers referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made after all he has no public recourse to criticism  it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cuetos first halfeffort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny oconnor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown but in rugby everything tends to even out over the  minutes the referee also missed englands danny grewcock taking out ronan ogara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line those were the standout moments in a classic game between the two old foes  but there were many more and one should not take away from those brian odriscolls winning try was as wellconceived as they come while charlie hodgsons brilliant kicking display was another highlight and ronan ogaras tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final  minutes two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on the first was denis hickies brilliant double tackle in the righthand corner he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson crossfield kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try irelands secondrow colossus paul oconnell was equally superb england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers unfortunately he ran into oconnell who hit him hard  very hard  and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover that spoke volumes about irelands backfoot display with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships ,1
mourinho plots impressive course  chelseas win at fulham  confirming their position at the premiership summit  proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season  they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain  they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won  at fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form as i said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is a priceless commodity noone can be anything other than highlyimpressed by mourinho he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho doesnt simply talk a good game  hes won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions ive also found him to be very realistic whenever ive heard him hes spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension  in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital i also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelseas squad i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind  if anything what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenals rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out  winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining fivefour is a hockey score not a football score in a threeagainstthree training match if the score reaches  i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get a result like that in a game of  against  is disgraceful  on a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenals defence confidence is a crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no  then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season ,1

kennedy looks to election gains  they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics  the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition  but the liberal democrats are entering the expected  election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his partys ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test  and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the partys westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election  the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow  as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson  that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than  a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election  there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as selfdelusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats  labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name ,2
kennedy predicts bigger turnout  voters pent up passion could confound predictions of a low turnout in the coming general election charles kennedy has said  the liberal democrat leader predicted concerns over iraq and other international and domestic issue would express themselves during the campaign his comments come as an inquiry looks at how best to boost voter turnouts exforeign secretary robin cook said people were not apathetic but fed up of pager politics and not being heard he like mr kennedy pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the iraq war  mr cook who is giving evidence to the power inquiry into voter turnout rates told bbc radio s today programme it was not fair to blame the public who were more interested in politics than ever before they are turned off by the way we do politics in britain theres a message there for politicians he urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to speak more from the heart we should be not so afraid to say what we stand for he also criticised the cult of personality politics theres far too much interest in celebrities politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry the government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout which fell to  in the last general election in  this has included bringing in directly elected mayors to head local authorities and trialling postal voting ,2
howard attacks pay later budget  tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon browns budget as vote now pay later spending plans  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole mr howard said everyone could see the chancellors sweeteners but these hid tax rises for hard working families he said labours faltering election campaign would not be helped by the package of measures mr howard added  mr browns budget was not about what was good for the country but all about the interests of the labour party the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging millions of people in to the net to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax we can all see the sweeteners but they hide the crippling tax rises for hardworking families that are inevitable if labour wins  he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste  to get people to vote now and pay later mr brown liked to rattle off magical balances conjured out of thin air in a bid to convince people there was no black hole in the nations finances the tory leader said this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers he said you now propose to borrow over the next six years no less than  billion so much for prudence the chancellors forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime ministers forecasts of weapons of mass destruction  mr browns council tax rebate for pensioners was  less than what the tories were offering mr howard said there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools people would face a clear choice at the election either more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives he said thats the battleground of this election thats what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on he concluded to loud tory cheering ,2

tory leader quits legal position  david mcletchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role  the scottish conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with tods murray did not influence the causes he supports but on friday he said i have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect mr mcletchie had received advice from holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare labour said he had cleverly not asked about paid advocacy a tory spokesman totally refuted any wrongdoing  mr mcletchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport the msp had been a partner for tods murray which has a client opposing the development mr mcletchie did not have a complaint made against him but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong  explaining his reason for quitting the post mr mcletchie said i have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with tods murray however i have no wish to see a similar situation arise again to avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of tods murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled i have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year i am proud to have been a part of tods murray for the last  years and wish it well in the future  labour msp christine may had said mr mcletchie was very clever to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section  of the code he was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section  the section on paid advocacy she said section  of the members interest order legally obliges msps to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner however msps code of conduct recognises a wider definition of parliamentary proceedings including a nonstatutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices such as motions  but a letter from holyroods chamber office chief ken hughes also made clear that mr mcletchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor commenting on mr mcletchies decision to stand down a scottish labour party spokesman said this should mean mr mcletchie doesnt breach the paid advocacy rules in future however it doesnt change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past  scottish national party holyrood leader nicola sturgeon accused mr mcletchie of failing to properly serve his constituents ms sturgeon said i think this whole episode has been very damaging for mr mcletchie and im sure he will be reflecting on it she added that she thought that the tories were an irrelevant party so she would not lose any sleep over it peter misselbrook executive partner of tods murray said mr mcletchie had been considering retirement later in the year he added david has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so ,2
child access law shakeup planned  parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers  curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied lord falconer said the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday he denied fathers activists had forced the changes telling the bbc there is a recognition that something is wrong between  and  couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year although in nine out of  separations there is no court intervention  lord falconer told bbc radio s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court but he opposed compulsory mediation saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude other plans include   parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements based on reallife examples that have worked in the past    extending incourt conciliation  more informal hearings before contested court cases    better access to legal emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet    legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes  judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a nuclear option which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the childs interests a spokesman said the aim of the new legislation was to provide a medium range of penalties such as fines community service orders compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews  failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents lord falconer said tagging may be going too far but lets have a debate about that full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published in the next two weeks a spokesman said  the governments proposals have met with disapproval from fathers rights groups john ison from the controversial group fathers  justice said it is very disappointing what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation jim parton from families need fathers said the new proposals lacked compulsion  we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order  then you know where you stand you know what the minimum access is otherwise you see people make agreements which then fall apart mr parton said he had been told by childrens minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election which is likely to take place in may  the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law theresa may shadow secretary for the family told bbc radio s today programme that the governments plans were inadequate and were papering over the cracks of the current system she said a conservative government would bring a radical reform of the family courts as well as enforcing a legal presumption of coparenting and compulsory mediation we want to make courts the last resort rather than the first resort she added the government says children cannot simply be divided up like property when a marriage collapses the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules rather than having rigid targets ,2
campaign cold calls questioned  labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls  the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing  for instance by asking about peoples voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioners office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the runup to the general election  but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications  the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service  he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations in summary whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue  earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them ,2

parliaments record of scandal  in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal  sex betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson  few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den for sprinkled among  floors of archives are blowbyblow accounts of marital breakups  and now you can search whats there online until  the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed remarriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or lifethreatening cruelty the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings dating back to  all recorded among the  items which fill the  floors of the parliamentary archives in parliaments victoria tower most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love this gives them the chance  divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses among the records is the story of jane campbell the first woman ever to divorce her husband that happened in  after she had discovered her husband edward addison had committed adultery with her sister jessy  a transcript of evidence from jessys maid amelia laugher shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed it must have been a killer blow to addisons case  he had already fled abroad rather than pay the  damages ordered by a civil court as well as making divorce history jane campbell won custody of her children  unusual for a woman at the time but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament  there are the protestation returns from   lists of the protestants who pledged to maintain the true reformed protestant religion there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament including composer george frideric handel in  and the mass of private bills which for example authorise the building of railways and roads contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them  tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters  the longest stretches for about m and is longer than the palace of westminster itself listing the names of appointed tax collectors this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue david prior assistant clerk of the archives says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research before you just could not do it you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material he says mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change mainly motivated by the potential of it which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us he says  the archives do of course hold records of high and low politics too for both houses of parliament including copies of all acts passed since   the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk records for the commons only date back to   anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in   but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history  parts of the bill of rights from  the death warrant for charles i the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law there is also the  act establishing  november as a thanksgiving day  the year after the gunpowder plot that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the th anniversary of guy fawkes conspiracy as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum parchment made from goats skin all human life is here ,2
election deal faltered over heath role  the tories failed to hold onto power in  after liberals demanded sir edward heath quit in return for cooperation  documents released after  years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic february general election liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government but it partly collapsed over the conservative leaders own role prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form a labour government the february  general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control sir edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis a miners strike and the subsequent threeday week labour emerged with the most seats  but its  mps were  short of the number mr wilson needed to form a majority  sir edward who had received more votes but had fewer mps believed he had the authority to remain at number  providing the  liberal mps would support his government he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the governments programme or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal mr thorpe was in high spirits having just led his party to a historic jump in support he also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties but sir edward said that was impossible because the labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a conservativeliberal pact  hours later sir edwards hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpes colleagues refused to support him jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally reads a telephone memo for mr heath  they feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister asked if this was his own view he said  no it was not i am very close to ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve  it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult the following day the stickling points had clearly become twofold mr thorpes colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edwards resignation mr thorpe told sir edward i am sorry this is obviously hell  a nightmare on stilts for you somehow i personally hope that we can work something out  four hours later sir edward called the liberal leader back to downing street in a last attempt at a deal the minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister mr thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime ministers colleagues documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a labourled coalition but he already knew mr wilson would not form a coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government ,2
fox attacks blairs tory lies  tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign say the tories  tory cochairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a hard right agenda dr fox told bbc radio if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war i guess you are going to lie about anything at all he would not discuss reports the party repaid  to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat  the prime minister ratcheted up labours preelection campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the partys spring conference he insisted he did not know the poll date but it is widely expected to be  may  in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday mr blair said i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of  downing street he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric then struggling to live up to the expectations and reaching the point of raised voices and throwing crockery he warned his supporters against complacency saying its a fight for the future of our country its a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win  mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy it would result in a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents policies and then attacking the lies what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and its going to be fear and smear he told bbc news the tory cochairman attacked labours six new pledges as vacuous and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid  to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters he said insisting he enjoyed a warm and constructive relationship to lord ashcroft  meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blairs words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester liverpool leicester somerset basingstoke shrewsbury dorset and torbay he said this is threeparty politics in the northern cities the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats in southern and rural seats  especially in the south west  the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives who are out of the running in scotland and wales the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a touchyfeely speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust ,2
will tory tax cuts lift spirits  michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts  should he win the next general election he has earmarked  billion that will be used to reduce taxes  although he still will not say which or how this was the preelection message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax  all the money would come from its  billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that  billion would go on spending plans with  billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eyecatching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts  the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard  can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned bn efficiency savings simply dont add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy  one of new labours greatest successes before the historic  election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely  and the prime minister probably hopes  that the economy will be the deciding factor ,2

petrol duties frozen brown says  chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his prebudget speech to the commons on thursday  mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments but this financial year because of volatility in the oil market he said the duty would be frozen during  many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution he said it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties  the rac welcomed the news calling it an early christmas present for motorists but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol environmental group transport  said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action said a spokesman in  the peoples fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slowmoving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes the chancellor did not raise duty that year but despite threats of more protests in  he added p per litre ,2

drink remark acts as diversion  the first ministers statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed  jack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnells comment was illadvised the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotlands binge drinking problems mr law said scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than  secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions  the onesentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and illadvised remark by the first minister if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage  mr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotlands fight against binge drinking he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink mr law added i think the remark was illadvised  but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland  we dont want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him he added here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to  teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark  the scottish national partys holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his illjudged comment and withdraw it immediately in a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context he told ms sturgeon it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i should encourage young people to get drunk that is completely untrue perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with  all for the sake of a simple soundbite ,2

mps murder sentence concern  murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new mps report  the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse  the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor at present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff  the minimum term they must serve  if the defendant pleads guilty but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy in july this year amanda champions killer james ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least  years  it would have been longer had he denied the charge  amandas uncle lewis champion told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing lastminute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty  the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill  as a result says the committee the government may need to relegislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales lord woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty the committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers lord woolfs sentencing guidelines council sgc caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime as a result murderers who face a year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police  mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliaments wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence he said we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals he said by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial  shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences  such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the governments claim to be tough on crime he said but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different he told bbc news ,2

blair ready to call election  tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on  may  the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll it has not shifted over the weeks there have been any number of signs that  was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labours stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust  and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign  to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster  to underline that economic message and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties tax and spend policies  during the phoney campaign labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning  bn cuts in public services the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labours plans was a cut and it looked like the labour campaign  which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health  was on the rocks then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger cuts  he was sacked for his gaffe but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track a second central argument will be over taxation with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again mr brown slaps that aside claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate as usual the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax other issues are certain to play a part  immigration and asylum the war on iraq law and order and education for example but as ever it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome and whatever that outcome  is set to be a far more lively even bitter campaign than s nonevent ,2

mac mini heralds mini revolution  the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month but does the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things dealt with at the outset  yes the mac mini is really really small and yes it is another piece of inspired apple design there is more to be said on the computers size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer inside that small box there is a g processor a cddvd player a hard drive some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system a dvd burner wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost and if you do not have a monitor keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also  it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under  you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications  apple software the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x the operating system as well as ilife  a suite of software which includes itunes web browser safari iphoto garage band and idvd i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x  of course users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs for people who want to do interesting things with their music photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer its a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses said mark sparrow technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine he added in essence its a laptop in a biscuit tin minus the screen and the keyboard the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technicallysavvy to experiment with their macs one user has already created a dock to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car  the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for incar entertainment  playing movies and music  as well as navigation another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre  ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes music films and photos  partly due to its small living room friendly design but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case  at least not in the here and now the hard drive  at gb for the larger model  is too small to be realistically used as media centre  while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content a media centre computer has to store music files and photos and as such gb just seems too small most pcs running windows media center have at least gb hard disks coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is not what it is not but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses so  is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing graham barlow editor of mac format understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint its just a mac but we should be very excited  its revolutionary in its size smaller than pcs looks looks better than pcs and the fact that its the first mac designed to really go for the lowcost pc market the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland bulky boxes there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on miniitx motherboards but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the homebuild enthusiast or expensive prebuilt options based around microsofts media center software but for the value the mac mini offers bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before apple is to be congratulated let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution  it is a mini revolution ,5
smart search lets art fans browse  if you dont know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting  artgarden developed by bts research unit is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works  the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection it chooses a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them so for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement th century and water a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tates digital programme for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didnt have a clue what i wanted he said the textbased search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead  he thinks the dominance of textbased searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object you dont arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldnt have asked for he said the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films ,5

toxic web links help virus spread  virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares  a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code those clicking on the poisoned links in email messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by antivirus software that combs through code contained in email attachments  the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on  november they exploit a windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier  like many other recent viruses bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for email addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch email messages to potential victims but unlike many other recent viruses does not itself travel via mail instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that when clicked on connect back to the machine that distributed that email essentially bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a paypal transaction  copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading  clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the email messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread finnish antivirus firm fsecure said that so far it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation  tim warner spokesman for antivirus firm finjan said you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code most firms have secured their email gateway said mr warner but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims the bofra family of viruses which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug can infect machines running windows    me nt xp and server  users running windows xp that have applied the sp update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits ,5

norway upholds napster ruling  a norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable mp files has been ordered to pay compensation by the countrys supreme court  frank allan bruvik was ordered to pay  kroner  to the music industry in norway he was a student when he set up his napsterno site which allowed users to submit and receive links to mp files bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry music industry bosses in norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium  frank allan bruvik set up the napsterno website as part of a school project in  while studying computer engineering in the norwegian town of lillehammer the website was not associated with the napstercom site in the usa which had been operating since  and was already facing legal action  bruviks site was online between august and november  and while it did not host any music at its peak it was providing links to more than  free files on other servers as well as providing links the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors a legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including norways performing rights society tono and the norwegian branches of sony music and universal music who saw it as an important test of principle  a norwegian court ruled in  that bruvik would have to pay  kroner to the music industry but the countrys court of appeal cleared him saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music however the supreme court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law it added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act and that bruviks actions were premeditated norways music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling because showed that music piracy would not be accepted  meanwhile in the usa a further  lawsuits against people alleged to have traded copyrighted songs were filed this week by the recording industry association of america the suits brought on behalf of the major record companies cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peertopeer services such as kazaa and edonkey as with preceding cases the fresh action was made against socalled john doe defendants who are identified only by the codes given to their computers internet connections ,5
learning to love broadband  we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson  one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work i can sit in a caf or a library with or without a wifi connection and research and write articles if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne a childrens writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection  we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dialup connection on her daughters laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dialup  she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively but the impact spread into her personal life too she did not take her children to the cinema during halfterm because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website and she did not know where to go fossilhunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found a book on fossils but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things she may be unusual but i do not think anne is alone  according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april  and numbers are climbing fast there will certainly be five million by the end of the year dialup users are switching to broadband my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason  it is part of the process of adaptation and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient it may not be the brave new world of streaming fullscreen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now and it is certainly better than slow access or no access just ask anne  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital ,5
millions to miss out on the net  by   of the uks population will still be without internet access at home says a study  around  million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant bt it compares to  million or  of the uk who are not currently online the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is wishful thinking the report concludes  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts  the gap between havenets and havenots has been much talked about but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more userfriendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it said adrian hosford director of corporate responsibility at bt costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological there is a hard rump of havenots who are not engaging with the net they dont have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits said mr hosford  as now the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families the older generation and the disabled  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital havenots the disabled will make up  and the elderly nearly a third by  the report forecasts organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem said mr hosford the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs explained mr hosford such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome he said if we dont address this problem now it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs education opportunities will be limited and theyll simply not be able to keep up with society he said the alliance for digital inclusion an independent body with members drawn from government industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks ,5
intel unveils laser breakthrough  intel has said it has found a way to put a siliconbased laser on a chip raising hopes of much faster networks  scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade  weve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intels photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia  and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang  show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it  telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these lightmoving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in highvolume manufacturing have been solved were trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easytomake filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semiconductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses its a technical validation that it can work he said ,5

china to overtake us net use  the chinese netusing population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years says a report  chinas net users number m but this represents less than  of the countrys  billion people market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the  million us users of the net by  the report says that the countrys culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations  already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations said william makower chief executive of panlogic in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare this combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china only  of chinese homes have telephones according to reports net usage tends to happen in the evening said mr makower they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf its fundamentally different usage to what we have here he said  net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the countrys eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends said mr makower many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life for instance said mr makower credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt the most popular way to pay is cashondelivery he said and thats quite a brake to the development of ecommerce the arrival of foreign banks in china due in  could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said mr makower but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar he said generally its more difficult for the government to be able to control it its real value is as an open window onto whats happening elsewhere in the world he said government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet its a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it said mr makower ,5
no half measures with halflife   could halflife  possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays its safe to say that this is the most highlyanticipated computer game of all time  fortunately it doesnt merely live up to its promise but exceeds it noone who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped all the money  or indeed time  is on the screen the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original  halflife having survived that skirmish in an desolate monsterinfested research facility hes back in another foreboding troublespot  the enigmatic city  it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city but as soon as your train pulls in to the station its clear that all is not well here sinister police patrol the unkempt streets and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be  you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedomfighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task it is not immediately explained what your objectives are nor precisely why everything is so ravaged finding out stepbystep is all part of the experience although you never fully get to understand what it was all about that does not really matter hl does not waste energy blinding you with plot underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective and immerses the player in the most vivid convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen there are no cutscenes to interrupt the flow exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you  whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a topnotch theme park thrillride wandering through halflifes world truly does feel like being part of a movie  considering its sophistication the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pcs components this is it on our test machine  an alienware system with an athlon  processor and atis radeon x video card  everything ran at full quality without trouble and the visual experience was simply jawdropping it is not simply that the surfaces textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them the haunting grim landscapes become strangely beautiful luckily you get time to pause midtask and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings so impressive are the physics that youll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move there are puzzles to be solved along the way pitched at about the right difficulty but most progress is achieved by force freeman is quickly reunited with the original games famous crowbar and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow  virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with and in realistic fashion you will be wowed by the attentiontodetail as you chip bits of plaster off walls chase a pigeon out of your way or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed at times halflife  feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome running around on foot is great enough but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles in gameplay terms hl somehow gets almost everything perfect and without resorting to the zombiesleapingoutofshadows approach of doom iii its all incredibly unsettling the vacant environment is distinctly eerie and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside  the game does have a couple of problems firstly the carefullyscripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people  a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue which makes for exciting moments but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once youve completed it if you like things openended and freeranging far cry will be a lot more pleasing but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run installing it proved a lifedraining siege that would test a saints patience developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy the box does warn you of this antipiracy measure but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed the temperamental valve servers and the time of day but it can take hours it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances  but luckily halflife  is up to the challenge it is surely the best thing in its genre

mobile networks seek turbo boost  thirdgeneration mobile g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services  that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the gsm world congress in cannes last week fast g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association at gsm siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second  up to  times faster than current g networks the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access a highspeed high bandwidth technology available now early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than  kilobits per second kbps on standard g networks  highspeed downlink packet access hsdpa  sometimes called super g  will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by ukbased research consultancy analysys a number of companies are developing the technology nokia and canadabased wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers  while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in widearea networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of g with hsdpa and other enhancements the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic wcdma g he added motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor g cell using a single hsdpa device but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised evdo  us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its g network at the end of last year we are expanding our network and deploying evdo technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprints vice president for technology development when the contract was announced as part of bn in multiyear contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around bn on evdo technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of  megabits a second and peak download rates of mbps mmo the ukbased operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on hsdpa using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of mbps from next summer on its isle of man g network and will eventually support speeds of up to mbps us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson  siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in  the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of  siemens  in collaboration with the fraunhofer germansino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology  has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band the speeds offered by g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for g licences but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dialup phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of  megabits a second  much faster than g this means users are likely to find g disappointing unless the networks are souped up if they arent those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multipleantennae devices and conduct field trials a commercial system could be as far away as  though siemens did not rule out an earlier date ,5

rolling out next generations net  the body that oversees how the net works grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last  years but it is just the start  in a sense we have hardly started in reaching the whole population the new chair of the internet engineering task force ietf brian carpenter says the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the nets architecture with broadband takeup growing services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net i think voip voiceover internet protocol allowing phone calls to be made over the net is very important  it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms says dr carpenter second it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure with voip you need very little infrastructure  a distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent  years at cern the european laboratory for particle physics as the new chair of the ietf his next big challenge is overseeing ipv the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web at cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web so he is wellplaced to take on such a task the nets growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work are open and free for anyone to use and work with  the net is built on a protocol called tcpip which means transmission control protocol and internet protocol when computers communicate with the net a unique ip address is used to send and receive information the ietf is a large international community of network designers operators vendors and researchers working on the evolution of the nets architecture and the way this information is sent and received they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps weve seen some interesting effects over last few years explains dr carpenter the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the s then there was a bit of a glitch in  we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth  that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies like china which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies the number of broadband subscribers via dsl digital subscriber line doubled in a year to  million according to figures released at the end of  the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate explained dr carpenter given it the net was designed for the whole community it has done well to reach millions if you want to reach the whole population you have to make sure it can scale up ipv the standard that will replace the existing ipv will allow for billions more addresses on the net and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world the actual number of addresses with ipv is limited to four billion ip addresses that clearly is not enough when you have  billion people to serve so there is technical solution the new version of ip  ipv it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits said dr carpenter standards are vital to something as complex as the net and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task the difference this next generation standard ipv will make to the average net user is almost invisible our first goal is that it ipv should make no difference  people should not notice a difference it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer a lot of the process will be invisible people are usually given an ip address without knowing it technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled said dr carpenter  the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security to dr carpenter the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour people have to be educated about sensible behaviour he says such as ignoring emails that claim you have won something  i dont think it is going to get worse people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do  just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards it is a neverending battle in a sense but he adds even if security has improved you still worry a bit unfortunately it is just part of life we have a duty to do what we can ,5
dvd copy protection strengthened  dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new antipiracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision  the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most but not all of the current dvd ripping copying programs used to pirate dvds ripguard is designed to reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer said the firm macrovision said the new technology will work in nearly all current dvd players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales  the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last  months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download  ultimately we see ripguard dvd evolving beyond antipiracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrows digital home and the upcoming highdefinition formats said steve weinstein executive vice president and general manager of macrovisions entertainment technologies group macrovision said ripguard was designed to plug the digital hole that was created by socalled decss ripper software it circumvents content scrambling system measures placed on dvds and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted dvds in minutes those copies could then be burned onto a blank dvd or uploaded for exchange to a peertopeer network macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against rent rip and return  where people would rent a dvd copy it and then return the original ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of  the company said the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs  if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anticopying measures ,5
games firms face tough future  uk video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles the industry warns  fred hasson head of tiga which represents independent developers said that more uk firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles three leading uk video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt microsoft sony and nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next  months microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that xbox  will be released in the us before the end of   the new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games mr hasson said in the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers he said there were about  independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities he said  mr hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines that figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the bbc news website  codemasters climax and rebellion  as consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost said gary dunn development director at codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles jason kingsley chief executive of rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger he added we have been through five technology transitions and survived so far each one has involved the death of some people all companies said they were investing in new tools  called middleware  in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control  simon gardner president of climaxs action studio said we are investing in superior tools and editors we are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams its vital we avoid huge teams he said climax was already directing about  of its resources to preparation for next generation titles mr dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming development and artistic talent if companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams at some point the talent is going to run out mr hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more businesslike there are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days some of them are still making games for peer group approval  that has to stop ,5

robotic pods take on car design  a new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyota  the companys vision for the single passenger in the st century involves the driver cruising by in a fourwheeled leaflike device or strolling along encased in an eggshaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet both these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the toyota stand at the expo  in aichi japan in march  the models are being positioned as socalled personal mobility devices which have few limits the open leaflike iunit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year built using environmentally friendly plantbased materials the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes the model allows the user to make tight onthespot turns move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music  also on display at the show will be the eggshaped ifoot this is a twolegged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick  standing at a height of well over seven feet  metres the unit can walk along at a speed of about kmh mph and navigate staircases into the bargain mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the birdlike legs that bend over backwards they are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university they clearly have eyecatching appeal which is in part the name of the game here and are linked to the imac and ipodtype niche which apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years  new different hitech image conscious products as always with these concept vehicles it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace  the personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities toyotas prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much us military research over the years and japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individuals particular mobility needs while toyotas prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility  experts though are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area  those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance now and certainly in the future are the elderly and infirm people dr gillingwater told the bbc news website you have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups design considerations also exist dr erel avineri of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled for example one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up it looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need this and other humanfactors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered said dr avineri in general introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation this may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle such singleperson vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport the concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions said dr gillingwater whats their range how userfriendly will they really be what infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used overall i think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions ,5
eu software patent law delayed  controversial new eu rules for the patenting of computerbased inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from poland  poland  a large and therefore crucial eu member  has requested more time to consider the issue especially as it relates to the patenting of software critics say the law would favour large companies over small innovative ones they say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software  polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computerimplemented inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software the planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the eu should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the us so for instance usbased amazoncom holds a patent on oneclick shopping critics claim the law which the eu says is needed to harmonise with the us is little more than a law on ideas patent rights it is claimed protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected eva lichtenberg a austrian green member of the european parliament said in a statement smaller innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them she added the european parliament has already clashed with the european union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic the directive has been subject to several previous delays ,5
mobiles get set for visual radio  the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but  could see another big innovation that wont just see a change in our mobile phone habits  it might alter the way we listen to the radio finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested  the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day  one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius a senior project manager at nokia was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium he said im very happy to say its not television what were talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today if you have a visual radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you dont know or theres a competition or vote that youd like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the onair broadcast youve just been listening to  that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in a similar way to digital televisions red button content  possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a realtime basis this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners  as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network and there will be a cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact itll be two or three pounds per month said mr wasenius but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dialup connections one thing that is for sure  assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be  million visual radioenabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of  basically visual radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before  the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners station manager steve taylor commented listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like mp music downloads and the latest gig tickets initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon  the  and   but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them  listen again to the interview on the radio five live website ,5

fileswappers ready new network  legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down  one site behind the success of the bittorrent fileswapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies  in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised that filesharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnovaorg which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to  now the man behind suprnovaorg who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new fileswapping network dubbed exeem in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa filesharing systems like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone there will be no centrally maintained list this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users an early public version of the software should be available before february sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development there were no plans for a linux or mac version he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program despite suprnova administrator slonceks involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis  users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream  dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peertopeer networks said exeem was the next evolution in filesharing systems but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared exeem cannot prevent pollution he said the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one thats full of crap like kazaa he said there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said mr pouwelse said that future versions of filesharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic its hard to compete with free he said noone from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the filesharing development ,5

online commons to spark debate  online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research ippr  existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the thinktank although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate in its report is online community a policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities adopting an ebaytype model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection what we are proposing is a civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication  like a prelegislation discussion  the idea of a civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of edemocracy at the oxford internet institute the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist it mentions goodpractice public initiatives like the bbcs ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues  but he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peertopeer interaction online at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each others reputation by how they treat other members using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built this could mean a civic commons would work within a nonmarket system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publiclyrecognised rules  egovernment initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues  with  of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic nonmarket interactions said mr davies there is a role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added the paper is part of the ipprs digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain ,5

pc photo printers challenge pros  home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from high street developers tests shows  a survey carried out by pc pro magazine looked at which of  home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab the tests found that images from top pc printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs but using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months warned the magazine  the group test of  home photo printers for pcs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as high street names such as jessops boots and snappy snaps the comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage it found that although some ink for printers now costs more than  per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a high street store if you really like your photos then its definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street but only if you choose the right printer said nick ross top tester at pc pro  mr ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many high street developers or even some professional wedding photographers some high street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were xin said mr ross but the test revealed that images xin and xin in size were cheaper to produce at home according to pc pro producing a print xin on an epson r printer using top quality paper costs  at jessops the same image would cost  and at snappy snaps  a xin snap at boots would cost  considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the high street and how silverhalide prints can fade in the sun were adamant that its now better cheaper and more convenient to print at home he said ann simpson marketing manager at snappy snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one she said many people are not skilled at getting the colour contrast and cropping right and they dont want the hassle she added the magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading it recommended avoiding socalled thirdparty inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest ,5

evil twin fear for wireless net  people using wireless highspeed net wifi are being warned about fake hotspots or access points  the latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say cranfield university experts once logged onto an evil twin sensitive data can be intercepted wifi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability london leads the global wifi hotspots league with more than  the number of hotspots is expected to reach  by  according to analysts users need to be wary of using their wifi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature said professor brian collins head of information systems at cranfield university  users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wifi device has its security measures activated he added bt openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wifi secure naturally people may have security concerns said chris clark chief executive for bts wireless broadband  but wifi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dialup he said bt openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot this means that users personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure said mr clark  in the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said dr nobles cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin cybercriminals dont have to be that clever to carry out such an attack said dr phil nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency  although wifi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use highspeed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a companys computer system public wifi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use but many home and company wifi networks are left unprotected and can be sniffed out and hijacked by anyone with the correct equipment bt advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly said mr clark we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museums dana centre in london on thursday ,5

apple laptop is greatest gadget  the apple powerbook  has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc  the  laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an alltime top  list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the  zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts andor electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a selfcontained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device  in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine  in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top  is the abacus which the magazine dates at  ad and put in th place other preelectronic gadgets in the top  include the sextant from  th position the marine chronometer from  nd position and the kodak brownie camera from  th position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top  which also includes the first flash mp player diamound multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number  in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number   sonys third entry in the top  is the cdp cd player from  who can forget the crystalline hissfree blast of madonnas like a virgin emenating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elseners knife the swiss army knife from  is at number  in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone rd the nintendo gameboy th and the pulsar quartz digital watch th the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser th s toy tamagotchi th and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler th  why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pdas  laptops etc  what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for its time a technological marvel  sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it  a laptop computer is not a gadget its a working tool  the sinclair executive was the worlds first pocket calculator i think this should be there as well  how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors  are the people who created this list insane  surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker  an interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early s blessed the original noteboook pc  the tandy  the size of a paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible  whats an apple powerbook   its out of date  not much of a gadget surely it has to be something simple  timeless  the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves   it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in  a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off  all top  are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current hightech obsession than anyhting else i say this as the swiss army knife only made no   sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with a true multitakings os shame the marketing was so bad  apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else  utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition  id also put apples newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason i only wish that vulcan incs flipstart wasnt just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs  the swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget i got mine  years ago still wearing and using it a lot it stood the test of time  psion organiser series  should be up there had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge  a first i think great product innovation  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers oferr mobile pc why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site its obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that  the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices  the psion series c the first most practical way to carry all your info around  i too would back the sinclair spectrum  without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now  id have put the mobile phone high up the list probably a nokia model  sinclair spectrum  k it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and thats what i do for a living now  i wish more modern notebooks  even apples newest offerings  were more like the pb particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses theyre invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use  congratulations to apple a deserved win ,5

windows worm travels with tetris  users are being warned about a windows virus that poses as the hugely popular tetris game  the cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on pcs that it has infected while users play the game the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks the risk of infection by cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild  the cellery worm does not spread via email like many other viruses instead it browses computer networks for pcs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines when it infects a machine cellery installs a version of tetris that users can play as the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it at the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines the virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing tetris pcs running windows   me nt  and xp could be vulnerable to the worm if your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed  rather than something that should cause concern said graham cluley spokesman for antivirus firm sophos so far the number of people infected by cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low sophos urged users and companies to update their antivirus software to keep themselves protected ,5
blind student hears in colour  a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps  victor wong a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models a number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work  the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself mr wong told the bbc news website for the sake of my own study  and for the sake of blind scientists generally  i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot in order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used the software then assigns one of  piano notes to individually coloured pixels  ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldnt work that well  mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision as the notes increase in pitch i know the colours getting redder and redder and in my minds eye a patch of red appears the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images ,5
podcasters look to net money  nasa is doing it yearold boys in bedrooms are doing it couples are doing it gadget lovers  male and female  are definitely doing it  it is podcasting  diy radio in the form of downloadable mp audio files they can done by anyone who has a microphone simple software the net and something to say some liken them to talking audioblogs because many complement textbased weblogs  diarylike sites where people share their thoughts they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net on demand and the movement is at very early stages its about real people saying real things and communicating says adam curry former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting he was one of a community of people who created ipodder a small computer program known as an aggregator  it collects and automatically sends mp files to any digital musicplaying device that can play wmp formats those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like and subscribe  for free  to that shows feed when a new podcast is available it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer it is totally going to kill the business model of radio thinks curry i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are he says and they are scared to death of the next generation  like my daughter who is   who dont listen to radio they are on msn theyve got their ipod their mp player theyve got their xbox  they are not listening to radio so how are they going to reach these audiences it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it  it is a fledgling movement but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it ian fogg jupiter research analyst thinks there could be potential for business but it could take an interesting turn if big companies like apple and microsoft get involved it is a nascent area but quite exciting it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over he says  podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about  a classic hybrid it is another aspect of the timeshifting of content  the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want when and wherever you want audiences are in the s s and s rather than millions more than  podcasts are currently listed currys daily source code  which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community  has s of thousands of listeners  but dave winer is doubtful he designed the format called rss really simple syndication which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed he is also writer of the longestrunning weblog on the net scripting news he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential not in its overhyped business promise  were the sources the people doing stuff and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what were doing no matter how you look at it commercialising this medium isnt going to make very much money he says podcasting is going to be a medium of niches with audiences measured in the single digits like email or blogs maybe in a few years maybe six or seven digits but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon curry and associate ron blooms new venture called podshow is to help ordinary people produce post distribute and market their podcasts because of the way podcasts work based on rss the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are readymade targets when you look at podcasting  wow this is a pretty interesting audience the audience is preselected they have decided to subscribe to your program explains curry advertising in his eyes can be tailored to podcasts to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive how i believe this will work is to create a network that in aggregation will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters i have    listeners i could make a couple of bucks off that but not much if you are talking a million podcasters and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves then that is kind of interesting essentially he says if you are doing a bass fishing podcast someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show he is clear the ads will not be the traditional inyourface type familiar to commercial radio now we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place  it is happening already coffeeloving curry has sold  worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site  others use inshow promotions like the dawn and drew show one eric rice has won sponsorship from warner bros he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative one thing is for sure they are not about to disappear in a hurry the creative forces behind radio are elated says curry for now he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community i should be knighted for this he adds with a wry chuckle people are going to be so happy to sit at home make their podcast and make a little money ,5

row brewing over peertopeer ads  music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience  the debate over the legitimacy of filesharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertisers dream come true and a branding nightmare paul myers chief executive of wippit  a peer to peer service which provides paidfor music downloads  believes it is time advertisers stopped providing oxygen for companies that support illegal downloading you may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service edonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include nat west vodafone o first direct ntl and renault he said in an open letter to the british phonographic industry last month  he urged people to follow his lead and dump brands associated with companies such as edonkey the bpi is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks networks like edonkey kazaa and grokster facilitate illegal filesharing the bpi strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue it said in a statement illegal filesharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services we are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses it said but the issue is often more complicated for advertisers said mark mulligan a music analyst with jupiter research this has been a problem for a long time ever since the days of napster he told the bbc news website  the reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience he said if you put the legality issues aside not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience he added meanwhile companies contacted by the bbc news website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing onetel adverts were spotted on edonkey this week and its response was typical we have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge it is not our policy to advertise through peertopeer networks read a statement from the discount phone firm it has requested the advert be removed immediately said a spokeswoman similarly telecommunications firm ntl blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites since the matter was brought to its attention last month the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites a spokesman told the bbc news website  however mr mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations while smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends this is no excuse for wellknown brands he said i would be surprised if these brands didnt have the knowhow to prevent this happening he said at the moment edonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very wellknown faces advert on its network many big brands have leveraged the opportunity including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world  senator john kerry and president george w bush said chief executive sam yagan there are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network he thinks peertopeer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where theyre most comfortable at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media he said ,5
progress on new internet domains  by early  the net could have two new domain names  the post and travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the nets administrative body the names are just two of a total of  proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann the other proposed names include a domain for pornography asia mobile phones an antispam domain and one for the catalan language and culture  the post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help coordinate the ecommerce efforts of national post offices  the travel domain would be used by hotels travel firms airlines tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online it is backed by a new yorkbased trade group called the travel partnership icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a xxx domain for pornographic websites a similar proposal has been made many times in the past but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it in  icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success three of the new socalled top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as museum and aero others such as info and biz were intended to be more generic in total there are in excess of  domain names and the majority of these are for nations but domains that end in the com suffix are by far the most numerous ,5
be careful how you code  a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson  if it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them if the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs a topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computerimplemented inventions and the way it amends article  of the  european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eus ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas  in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to reenter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on oneclick online purchase it is a small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it  we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long the new proposals go back to  although argument about patentability of software and computerimplemented inventions has been going on since at least the mids they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then represented in their original form some national governments seem to be aware of the problems poland has rejected the proposal and germanys main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned  the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an a item and can only be approved or rejected no discussion or amendment is allowed so why should we be worried first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow  more directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone elses patent this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright patents are not copyright but something much stronger a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately i have never to my shame managed to read lord byrons childe harolds pilgrimage if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence the same does not hold for a patent if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then i am in trouble under patent law at least in the us coincidence is no defence the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are usbased and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or crosslicense with other patent holders  even this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer and other browsers infringed an eolas patent that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnulinux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements the damage to software will not happen overnight of course if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas and it will damage europes computer industry we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law  bill thompson is a

open source leaders slam patents  the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents  in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement mitchell kapor chairman of the mozilla foundation warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future linux is a freelyavailable alternative to microsofts windows it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made  of its patents freely available other companies are expected to follow suit  there are between  and  registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they cant afford to take them to court said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future if totally pushed to the wall  because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce softwareof course theyre going to unleash the wmds mr kapor is reported as saying microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body intellect of which it is a member as far as intellect is concerned open source and patents have coexisted for many years without problems said spokeswoman jill sutherland the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other she added ,5
musicians upbeat about the net  musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music a survey has found  the study by us researchers pew internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against filesharing while most considered filesharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders even successful artists dont think the lawsuits will benefit musicians said report author mary madden  for part of the study pew internet conducted an online survey of  musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april   they ranged from fulltime successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music we looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry ms madden told the bbc news website we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of  going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web more than  offered free samples online while twothirds sold their music via the net independent musicians in particular saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically said ms madden they are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright  perhaps surprisingly opinions about online filesharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry  through the recording industry association of america riaa it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us it found that most artists saw filesharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing said one musician quoted by the report its hard to keep making records if they dont pay for themselves through sales however  said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters many suggested that rather than fighting filesharing the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy said ms madden ,5

losing yourself in online gaming  online role playing games are timeconsuming but enthralling flights from reality but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously  when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight  and to offer a warning an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair  keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texas some of the comments were humorous this game is so good im not going to get it theres no way i could limit the hours id spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from england  but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpg shame they are getting more popular as you know this problem is just going to mushroom wrote stuart stantondavies in huddersfield scaremongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices  gaming is like any other pastime  it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetry  unfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make however stories about gamers spending  to  hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some  massively multiplayer online role playing games  mmorpgs  allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds the scope of these games  like warcraft everquest ultima among others  is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinite part of the problem is grinding  by which gamers have to perform longwinded mindless tasks to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure such openendedness brings with it a desire to keep playing not for no reason is everquest eq nicknamed evercrack e hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently i used to play the online roleplaying game everquest a lot by a lot i mean probably  to  hours a week on average and on weeks where i didnt have to work as many as  or  hours  he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasnt that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much you lie you dont go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv a good thing presumably he wrote explaining how everquest took over his time he quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquest  let us be clear  such obsession is rare but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far almost  people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month only a fraction will descend into obsessives the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind jane who runs the website compiles a chronicle of heartrending stories i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than some people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she said one unnamed correspondent  all are anonymous  wrote on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me  i cant talk to him while he is playing there is absolutely no point as he doesnt hear me or is so distracted that i get a ummm ya a few minutes after i ask him a question  gaming widows has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers but for some it is not in the least funny another correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness and some of them are even sadder today our son was five days old the sad truth is my husband spent  hours today playing his warcraft game he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream and games ever more immersive there will be no hiding place for social problems    i wish  hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isnt an  hour stretch isnt that surprising  ive known people to play  hours at a stretch i know of people who are spending their weeks holiday from work playing warcraft i know of people who would play evercrack in shiftswaking at am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they needed to appear i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life by all standards many of us are addicts so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playingor do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting  sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them i have been in a long term relationship for over  years  since that began games have become more and more complex and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time  i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct i play games a lot definately over  hours a week but i dont go missing work or other commitments in order to play games  i have about a year ago deleted every game on my computer rpgs are the worst  the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword unlike books or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing when you stop playing youre at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your  hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since youve gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one  despite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality  my advice to gaming widows is if you cant beat em join em that is try playing it yourself if he wants to play as well well at least youll be together somewhere  i was an addict and it cost me my relationship i still play now but without the guilt  hehe how long have i played in one sitting from morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink now thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate  obsessive behaviour is of course always cause for concern but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality obviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem this problem however has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be real any more than  for example  an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human if mmorpgs have a unique danger in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world but rather that they can be easily accessed  the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern  hour culture  the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them theres always another quest to do a few of my friends have only had about  hours sleep since it was released friday  championship manager consumed my life for years one particular session started at about pm on a sunday paused for a brief sleep at am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another  hour session the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that  i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did others were less fortunate and dropped out of college now that i am holding a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague  when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from am till pm when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well hence justifying playing it all evening i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job  when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so im trying not to spend so much time on there its not easy i feel as if ive got a real addiction going on here  for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal once it is completed that is it i am finished time to move on i become obsessed to complete the goal so from that standpoint it is an addiction in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pit it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times  in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world pretty scary implications if you think about it  i cant buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it  i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level im sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor slowly building up my character stopping only for food and toilet breaks thankfully i made a clean break and actually managed to sell my jedi account for   which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum  seven years ago i began playing ultima online this game dominated  years of my life they were  wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv  gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogres but somehow i found time to get out even met someone and got married has my life changed hell no i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning on with the fun  online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates  many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families relationships and good careers a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs the message to the government is clear either legalise drugs or outlaw online gaming  sounds like there are some sad stories here  and i can believe them all i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it is i am resolute that it will not take over my life it certainly gets in the way though i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it  i think im obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest  and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to im always thinking in the back if my mind that id rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united  i am obsessed with online role playing games its not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation  goals to achieve etc i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning  as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits such as being a couch potato the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature  these games are like most things  too much of anything is a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun  living in korea at the moment they have lots pc bangs internet cafes nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games  i play xbox live every day i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix the longest i played was a  hour straight session i know i play for to long but its an obsession that i cant control can you reccomend a counsellor  this is not a wind up but something im increasingly concerned with  me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day were both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual its getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying real life  i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out the longest period i played was  hrs straight i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version couldnt help myself in future im going to regulate my time far more strictly great game  having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into  unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a persons health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse  these people are pathetic they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and online universe absolutely meaningless  hours when i was a kid at school and i was on half term,5

intel unveils laser breakthrough  intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light  scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade  weve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intels photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia  and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang  show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it  telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these lightmoving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in highvolume manufacturing have been solved were trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easytomake filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semiconductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses its a technical validation that it can work he said ,5
itunes user sues apple over ipod  a user of apples itunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an ipod to play songs  he says apple is breaking anticompetition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site apple which opened its online store in  after launching the ipod in  uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the ipod californian thomas slattery filed the suit in the us district court in san jose and is seeking damages  apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice the lawsuit states the key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like itunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market according to ernest gellhorn an antitrust law professor at george mason university as a practical matter the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims prof gellhorn said apple has sold more than six million ipods since the gadget was launched and has an  share of the market for portable digital music players market research firm npd group has reported  more than  million songs have been sold by the itunes music store since it was launched apple has unlawfully bundled tied andor leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players and viceversa the lawsuit said mr slattery called himself an itunes customer who was also forced to purchase an apple ipod if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to a spokesman for apple declined to comment apples online music store uses a different format for songs than napster musicmatch realplayer and others the rivals use the mp format or microsofts wma format while apple uses aac which it says helps thwart piracy the wma format also includes socalled digital rights management which is used to block piracy ,5
net regulation still possible  the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said  content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tvquality video online becomes a norm at a debate in westminster the net industry considered the options lord currie chairman of superregulator ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option at the debate organised by the internet service providers association ispa lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation  the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or selfregulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion  some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of  and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb itv and the bbc head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms how risque can i be in this new age with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely i can push it to the limit he said  in fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in  this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several highprofile legal cases richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible huge changes are afoot in  he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net the bbcs planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said  one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said mr ayers as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign if content is ondemand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it there is no watershed on the net said mr burke ,5
smartphones suffer skulls attack  owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper  those downloading the software could find all the icons on their  phone swapped for images of skulls when installed the malicious program also locks many of the s functions making it hard to use and harder to repair the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones  the file nicknamed skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free addons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the  phone the skulls program is labelled as a file called extendedthememanagerzip  once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with nonworking versions so the phone becomes almost useless the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring a security warning symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself despite this finnish antivirus lab fsecure said it had sporadic reports of  owners being caught out by it the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee symbian phones produced by sony ericsson motorola benq arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program ,5

games enter the classroom  video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom  with violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving said martin owen at futurelab mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error  futurelab is a nonprofit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpoolbased games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market learning games were somewhat oldfashioned and we didnt see anyone else doing what we wanted to do said dr carl gavin managing director of lateral visions the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element the result is racing academy a massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well  it is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational said mr owen players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs before and after racing teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks mr owen  the game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other said ben williamson a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the childrens desire to rise to a challenge games in the classroom need to support the teacher it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge he said professor angela macfarlane based at bristol university has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms  use of games in schools has been patchy she found with sim city proving the most popular traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used socalled edutainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research it is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies she wrote in a paper entitled games and learning lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles  persuading developers to write for the educational market this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing already there are games on the market such as civilisation and age of empire that have educational elements said mr owen even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people he said it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though ,5
us woman sues over ink cartridges  a us woman is suing hewlett packard hp saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date  the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs refilling even when it does not the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february  hp the worlds biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change  but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a builtin expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said the lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last  months the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as  but it could cost up to  in running costs over an month period due to cartridge a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uks office of fair trading oft which concluded in a  report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers ,5

a decade of good website design  the web looks very different today than it did  years ago  back in  yahoo had only just launched most websites were textbased and amazon google and ebay had yet to appear but says usability guru dr jakob nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the  core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today roughly  of the things we found  years ago are still an issue today he said some have gone away because users have changed and  have changed because technology has changed  some design crimes such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said dr nielsen  but theres great stability on usability concerns he told the bbc news website dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a sites total design were as important as ever its necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such he said they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off he said but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband  dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google amazon ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful said dr nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net  all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet he said they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user none of them have a fancy or glamorous look he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied in the future dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online they are becoming like the operating system to the internet he said but he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better currently he said search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use  terms in  only  words were used i think its amazing that we have seen a doubling in a year period of those search terms said dr nielsen  you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme go digital ,5

europe backs digital tv lifestyle  how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious european project  in nice last week the european commission announced its networked  electronic media nem initiative its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme more than  experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia intel philips alcatel france telecom thomson and telefonica it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together but again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible standalone solutions working a longterm strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required  the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget this is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management drm schemes currently drm solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the worlds dominant drm scheme is huge although entertainment is an obvious first step it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare energy efficiency and control of the smart home the year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years  simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media ,5
how to make a greener computer  the hitech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware bill thompson thinks its about time  my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge now you cant buy petrol with lead additives and were all better off as a result chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways  apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic mercury cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops mobiles and music players  one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive a welldesigned electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling  they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears it is as they say about time we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage the car engine is a case in point lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder a phenomenon called knocking so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work so it took decades before it was done were seeing the same thing in the technology industry and as a result there are billions of devices from old mobile phones to antique handhelds that will have to be recycled in years to come if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc keeping the monitor and other peripherals  even if apple does not get its way four or fiveyearold computers are not good enough to run modern programs and its not unreasonable to replace them but what do we do with the old ones  ive just looked around my office and i find two monitors an old  pc two old handhelds three ancient laptops four antique mobile phones a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use they are all old enough to be hazardous waste  the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead  but its possible that some of the components could be useful i could take them up the to the council recycling centre but its a mile drive away across town and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste a box for glass cans and paper that can be recycled and a black bin for the rest there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too id probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box  at least eventually  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital ,5

blogger grounded by her airline  a us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary  queen of the sky otherwise known as ellen simonetti evolved into an anonymous semifictional account of life in the sky but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of inappropriate images delta airlines declined to comment  i was really shocked i had no warning ms simonetti told bbc news online i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog i thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites ms simonetti was suspended on  september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past  ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mothers death she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies the airlines name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to ms simonetti  the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother we often take pictures on flight or on layovers i just though why not include them on my blog for fun i never meant it as something to harm my company and dont understand how they think it did harm them ms simonetti said she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web of the  or so images on the site only one showed ms simonettis flight wings they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up she said the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended as far as ms simonetti knows there is no company antiblogging policy there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear  jeffrey matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers he said it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy you have to remember that as an employee you dont have total free speech anymore he said mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they employees do cross the line he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line he said ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken if they had asked me just take down the blog i would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option she said this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it if i had known it would cost me my job i would not have done that ,5
web radio takes spanish rap global  spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanishlanguage music but what you will not find is much spanishlanguage hiphop  hiphop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanishspeaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad but now a us company is bringing rap and hiphop en espanol to computer users everywhere los caballeros de plan g are one of mexicos hottest hiphop acts they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey but most mexican hiphop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanishspeaking world rarely get a chance to hear the groups tracks on the radio  you cant really just go on the radio and listen to hiphop in spanish its just not accessible says manuel millan a native of san diego california its really hard for the spanish hiphop scene to get into mainstream radio you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world millan and two friends set out to change that  they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally  mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible so millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradiocom the name says it all it is webbased radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hiphop tracks the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate all the user has to do is download a media player there are no djs it is just music streamed over the net for free suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan g are producing export quality rap  the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hiphop right now the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage but the production values are improving and artists such as argentinas mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradiocom hes considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hiphop scene millan says he really hasnt had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but hes definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanishspeaking world currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradiocoms top  as is cuban artist papo record every countrys got its own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says latinohiphopradiocom has been up and running for a couple of months now the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world right now mexico leads the way accounting for about  of listeners but web surfers in spain are logging in as well  about  of the web stations traffic comes from there that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanishlanguage rap and hiphop millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hiphop production that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences  but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradiocoms top  his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hiphop leader in spain on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against  emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact its basically him bragging that hes one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says and its pretty much true he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable its amazing latinohiphopradiocom is hoping to expand in the coming year millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hiphop and rap  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbhboston coproduction ,5

mobile multimedia slow to catch on  there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular  consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a  increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of  according to analysts gartner more than  million handsets were sold globally between july and september  a period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so  in fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing figures gathered by continental research shows that  of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message mms up from  in  this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to  million getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets  also he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to according to continental research  of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation only  regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to peoples reluctance to start sending them said mr jain they ask themselves if im streaming video from one handset to another will it work he said theres a lot of user apprehension about that  there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users  noone wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wappush to get multimedia to their customers but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india the largest mobile firm in the country the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems while not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content as a result  of the subscribers to the hutch alive which uses cellticks broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said yaron toren spokesman for celltick until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting through ,5

looks and music to drive mobiles  mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner  more than  million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date the figure was  more than in  and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in  said analysts although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slowdown in replacement sales  all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years time they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones  but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner third generation mobiles g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who dont really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms  more likely to drive sales in  would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services the motorola razr v phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in  she added this was not a womens thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of selfexpression too it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi  people are after something that is nicelooking and together with that there is the entertainment side this year music will have a part to play in this the market for fulltrack music downloads was worth just  million  million in  but is set to be worth  billion  million by  according to jupiter research sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w which combines a digital music player with up to  hours battery life and a two megapixel camera in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones apple said the new itunes music player would become motorolas standard music application for its music phones but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life ,5
friends fear with lost mobiles  people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends  more than  of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years more than half  of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book a fifth rely entirely on mobiles about  of uk adults own at least one mobile according to official figures it is estimated that  of over s own a mobile according to intervoice but the figures are higher for those aged between  and   most  to yearolds  and  to yearolds  own at least one nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts information again if the phone was lost stolen or replaced  the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book many mobile owners do not bother to make backups of their contact details and with people changing their phones once a year on average it becomes a problem they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart relying on the mobile phone book instead were a nation of lazy soandsos david noone from intervoice said we put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly cant be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart one in three women the survey said thought if they lost their phones it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether most  said they had no idea what their partners number was mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide backup services on the network itself instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves  generally information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software sim backup devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds  but some operators offer customers free webbased backup services too orange told the bbc news website that those with orange smartphones could use the my phone syncing service which means backups of address books and other data are created online for nonsmartphone users a memory mate card could be used to back up data on the phone o also offers a free webbased syncing service which works over gprs and gsm neither vodafone or tmobile currently offer a free network service for backups but encourage people to use sim backup devices it is thought that about  phones are lost or stolen every month and  of total street crime involves a mobile mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year globally more than  million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of   more than the previous year according to analysts it is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of  ,5
lifestyle governs mobile choice  faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests  instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an indepth study by telecommunications company ericsson historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericssons consumer and enterprise lab we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website  for the study ericsson interviewed  mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone peoples habits remain the same said dr bjorn they just move the activity into the mobile phone as its a much more convenient way to do it  one good example of this was diarywriting among younger people he said while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone  especially one equipped with a camera  helps them keep it in a different form youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles ericssons research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists only when about  of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it  once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop however he said now  of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month in  the figure was  similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise in  only  of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month now the figure is  similar rises have been seen in many other european nations dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life ,5
speech takes on search engines  a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results  called speegle it has the look and feel of a normal search engine with the added feature of being able to read out the results scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments  the edinburghbased firm cec has married speech technology with everpopular internet search the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web  according to search engine ask jeeves around  of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad said speegle founder gordon renton the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people although the royal national institute of the blind rnib is looking at the technology he added but julie howell digital policy manager at the rnib expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind peoples experience of the web there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be she said blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way she added  the site uses a technology dubbed panavox which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dialup connections visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known if silent search engine google google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments said mr renton it is not a ripoff we are doing something that google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery he said speegle is proving popular with those learning english in countries such as japan and china the site is bombarded by people just listening to the words the repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots said mr renton ,5
more women turn to net security  older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks according to a twoyear study  the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus spam and spyware attacks rose by  each year between  and  the study for net security firm preventon shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers it is thought that  of those buying home net security programs are retired for the last three years that has gone up by an average of  but more retired women  were buying security software than retired men the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that highspeed broadband net connections can pose to surfers  the study predicts that  of all home pc net security buyers will be women in  they could even overtake men as the main buyers by  if current rates persist according to the research i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong said one over woman who took part in the research  you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last  years paul goosens head of preventon told the bbc news website now we are seeing real people  both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online particuarly if they are new to broadband he said  programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dialup users with a slower connection too said mr goosens security software should be easy to use with simple interfaces and instructions written in nontechnical language he added the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about email viruses highprofile complaints about rogue diallers and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of antivirus firewall and spywareremoval programs too without protection these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally  more than  pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses a study from security from symantec showed last year viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer according to net security experts programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs many based in eastern europe over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because said mr goosens they are reported in the press much more you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat they are asking the right questions he explained it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider that they are safe to connect to the net an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes by the end of the year it is thought that more than  of uk homes will have broadband net access in july last year the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dialup for the first time according to the office of national statistics ,5

latest opera browser gets vocal  net browser opera  due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors  the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud the voice features based on ibm technology are currently only available in the windows version opera can also magnify text by up to  times and users can create style sheets its developers say this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users  another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling  the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people our idea was to take a first step in making humancomputer interaction more natural said ms hanson people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard so this makes the web a more handsfree experience unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice around  voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone the voice recognition function is currently only available in english opera is free to download but a paidfor version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support opera began life as a research project  a spinoff from norwegian telecoms company telenor its browser is used by an estimated  million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms ,5
how to make a gigapixel picture  the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands  the finished image is  billion pixels in size  making it about  times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras the huge image of delft was created by stitching together  single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot if printed out in standard  dots per inch resolution the picture would be m high and m long  the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail the website is already proving popular and currently has more than  visitors every day  the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the  gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge  the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november  that image portrayed bryce canyon national park in utah and was made up of  separate photographs the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons image he did it all by hand which was an enormous effort and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques it would be feasible to build a larger image said jurgen den hartog one of the tno researchers behind the project we were not competing with mr lyons but it started as a lunchtime bet  the dutch team used already available technologies although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the highresolution image  we had to rewrite almost all the tools me den hartog told the bbc news website all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image so we had to develop one ourselves the  component pictures were taken on july  by a computercontrolled camera with a  mm lens each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days following the success of this project and with promises of help from others the tno team is considering creating a full degree panoramic view of another dutch city with even higher resolution ,5
california sets fines for spyware  the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california  from  january a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware the legislation which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information at its worst it has the ability to hijack personal data like passwords login details and credit card numbers the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate  one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer users websurfing it can result in people being bombarded with popup ads that are hard to close in washington congress has been debating four antispyware bills but california is a step ahead the states consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware consumers are able to seek up to  in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that  of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring  separate spyware programs currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and adaware ,5
peertopeer nets here to stay  peertopeer pp networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts  once several highprofile legal cases against filesharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from pp technology the expert panel probed the future of pp at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january the first convictions for pp piracy were handed out in the us in january william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software since the first successful filesharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of pp technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy but that is going to change very soon according to the panel  the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate pp networks  which are not illegal in themselves  and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks but they have slowly realised that pp is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of pp network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copyprotection standards  but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with pp cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media when they cant stop it they try to control it then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business in august  the san franciscobased us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two filesharing networks the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the s vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal  pp networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files instead it uses direct connections between computers  or clients there are now many different types of pp systems than work in different ways pp nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use pp technology to distribute them the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many the global entertainment industry says more than  billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure filesharers away from free content sales of legallydownloaded songs grew tenfold in  with  million tracks bought online in the us and europe in  months the ifpi reported this week but such download services are very different from pp networks not least because of the financial aspect  there are several moneyspinning models that could turn pp into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies paidforpassalong in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiserbased options are all being considered we see there are going to be different models for commoditising pp said marc morgenstern vice president of antipiracy firm overpeer  consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industrys potential controlling grip on content and pp technology by continuing to use it for their own creations unsigned bands for example use pp networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign increasingly what you are seeing on pp is consumercreated content said derek broes from microsoft they will probably pay an increasing role in helping pp spread he said looking into pps future file sharing is just the beginning for pp networks as far as mr broes is concerned once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said filesharing is the tip of the iceberg ,5
firefox browser takes on microsoft  microsofts internet explorer has a serious rival in the longawaited firefox  web browser which has just been released  few people get excited when some new software is released especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of prelaunch fervour fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version  of the browser is available the release of firefox  on  november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giants internet explorer browser  firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in  much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february earlier incarnations but which had the same core technology were called phoenix and firebird since then the software has been gaining praise and converts not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsofts internet explorer rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability  internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie before july this year according to websidestory internet explorer was used by about  of web surfers that figure had remained static for years in july the ie using population dropped to  and by the end of october stood at  the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner  of the windows using netbrowsing population firefox is proving popular because at the moment it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsofts program for instance firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them it blocks popups has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed  one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras or extensions produced for it the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program this has resulted in many different addons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels firefox which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix also has a growing number of vocal netbased fans a campaign coordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the  needed for a full page advert in the new york times the campaign set itself a target of recruiting  volunteers ten days in to the campaign  people had signed up and now about  has been raised the ad is due to run sometime in a threeweek period in late novemberearly december the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ies hold on the web using population from alternative browsers such as opera safari amaya and even netscape ,5

fileswappers ready new network  legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down  one site behind the success of the bittorrent fileswapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies  in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised that filesharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnovaorg which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to  now the man behind suprnovaorg who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new fileswapping network dubbed exeem in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa filesharing systems like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone there will be no centrally maintained list this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users an early public version of the software should be available before february sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development there were no plans for a linux or mac version he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program despite suprnova administrator slonceks involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis  users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream  dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peertopeer networks said exeem was the next evolution in filesharing systems but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared exeem cannot prevent pollution he said the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one thats full of crap like kazaa he said there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said mr pouwelse said that future versions of filesharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic its hard to compete with free he said noone from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the filesharing development ,5

ink helps drive democracy in asia  the kyrgyz republic a small mountainous state of the former soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the countrys elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting  this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population in an effort to live up to its reputation in the s as an island of democracy the kyrgyz president askar akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision  the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mids with a hastily pushed through referendum in  reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with  deputies the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections  the german embassy the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes  the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated the ink is sprayed on a persons left thumb it dries and is not visible under normal light  however the presence of ultraviolet light of the kind used to verify money causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light at the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voters fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have hisher left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors  the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics notably ukraine and georgia the use of ink has been controversial  especially among groups perceived to be progovernment  widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep  a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society  the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems others such as the aggressively middle of the road coalition of nongovernmental organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as serbia south africa indonesia and turkey the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink  but as the elections in afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems the use of invisible ink is not without its own problems in most elections numerous rumors have spread about it  in serbia for example both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink  various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward however in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off the ink stays on the finger for at least  hours and for up to a week the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills the passage of the inking law is nevertheless a clear step forward towards free and fair elections the countrys widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for  february  david mikosz works for the ifes an international nonprofit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies ,5
mobile audio enters new dimension  as mobile phones move closer to being a ubiquitous allinone media player audio is becoming ever more important but how good can that sound be from such a small device  the sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head the surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multispeaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone british firm sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed d audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers firms amd and srs both offer stereowidening technology for mobile phones but sonaptics managing director david monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional d audio on a mobile  there are quite a few basic technologies out there making the sound seem a bit bigger headphones a bit nicer  noone has really tried before to make proper d positional audio  where an individual channel can be moved around sonaptic has been working with japanese mobile network ntt docomo to set standards for d audio on mobile phones in the last few months handsets from nec fujitsu and mitsubishi have been released on to the japanese marker which have chips produced by yamaha and rohm with sonaptics technology the technology has been around on pcs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone said mr monteith  the technology works through applying the science of psychoacoustics and grew out of medical research done by the companys research director dr alastair sibbald we are basically trying to fool your ears into thinking sound is coming from areas it actually isnt your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset the structure of the ear works as a d encoder for sound  helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating sonaptics audio processing algorithms mimic that d encoding giving the impression that sound is coming from the left right and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source mr montieth says if the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other  if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear  the shape of your ear causes differences in sound from one ear to the other we are synthesising those differences sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading handhelds often have limitations  screens will be small by definition if you want to get impact from media you are running  either a movie a game or watching tv  if you want it to be more immersive then our technology can help a fishing game is the first title to use the technology creating a d sound field while the gamer plays driving games and shoot em ups using the technology are in development the technology can also be used for music  giving songs a much more expansive and immersive feel sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing its important we only use  or  of the processor otherwise you wont be able to play a game on the handset explained mr montieth the company is now looking to the us and european markets where it has been working with network vodafone we have focused first on japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market we knew japan would be the first place to have the handsets that could use our technology there should be handsets out in the uk in the next six months ,5

tough rules for ringtone sellers  firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks  the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones  in the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone  if you are not on the operators portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because its a problem of how people discover your services he said to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of  websites such as grumbletextcouk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn people did not know they were being offered a subscription service we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added  the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uks phone firms everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox  its all about transparency he said consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it the consumer has a right to be protected he said christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if thats done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said the new rules came in to force on  january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said we do not have to say why we can just cut them off under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal stop command sent via text message he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn ,5
freeze on antispam campaign  a campaign by lycos europe to target spamrelated websites appears to have been put on hold  earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words stay tuned no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial antispam campaign  lycos europes make love not spam campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes people were encouraged to download the screensaver which when their pc was idle would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at  capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites but the plan has proved controversial  monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline  the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are redrafting computer use laws to make them specific offences lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page with the words stay tuned the numerical internet address of the site has also changed this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism attacking a spammers website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick said graham cluley senior technology consultant for sophos not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up ,5
warning over tsunami aid website  net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims  the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage however dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster  the link to the website is contained in a spam email that is currently circulating the messages subject line reads urgent tsunami earthquake appeal and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts the web address of the fake site is decukorg which could be close enough to the official wwwdecorguk address to confuse some people keen to donate patricia sanders spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down she said the spam emails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web  dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation bt and decs hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said  ms sanders said sending out spam email to solicit donations was not decs style and that it would never canvass support in this way she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed none of the email addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid one email sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud emails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile other scam emails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information in a monthly report antivirus firm sophos said that two email messages about the tsunami made it to the top  hoax list during january another tsunamirelated email is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsofts outlook email program anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to ,5

bond game fails to shake or stir  for gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of  but also the classic shootemup that accompanied it and left n owners glued to their consoles for many an hour  adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the originals massive sense of fun this however is not a sequel nor does it relate to the goldeneye film you are the eponymous renegade spy an agent who deserts to the bond worlds extensive ranks of criminal masterminds after being deemed too brutal for mi your new commanderinchief is the portly auric goldfinger last seen in  but happily running around bent on world domination with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turners similarlytitled theme song the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury which enables a degree of xray vision  rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by a plummeting helicopter the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a  game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to  recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise this title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like a lucky accident the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination admittedly the competition has been tough even in recent weeks with the likes of halo  and half life  triumphing in virtually every department what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaos as is the trend of late you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos meaning that frustration is often the outcome and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed a minute red dot passes for a crosshair although the collisiondetection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky and you will not always know you have picked them off since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game makers allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights  no time is risked with a measured buildup  by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hatfiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion  there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash but the ingame niggles combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thoughtthrough will make this a disappointment for most diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings the game is weak not completely unplayable then again  fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras given james bonds healthy pedigree in past games there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip a commendable idea that just has not worked that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return  goldeneye rogue agent is out now ,5
podcasts mark rise of diy radio  an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to  songs which is a lot of space to fill  but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers it is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj video jockey adam curry podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast a podcast is basically an internetbased radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home they need only a microphone a pc and some editing software they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free using technology based on xml computer code and rss  really simple syndication  listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which mr curry has pioneered the latest mp files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically  mr curry records hosts edits and produce a daily  minute podcast called the daily source code he wants to make podcasting the next big thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry i was always into technologies and wires he explains my parents gave me the radio shack  project kit which allows you to build an am transmitter and subsequently an fm transmitter i had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio  mr curry is american but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the dutch capital he tried university in the us and ended up back in holland where he hosted a music video show he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top  video countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet at a certain point in  i was driving in on a friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid you know im going do the top  countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning so after i finished the show i quit i said on air its been great ive been here for seven years at that point theres something on the internet ive got to go find it and ill see you later  but mr currys technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and highspeed internet connections were becoming more widely available the mp format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before  most importantly mr curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing listen to  of the radio that you hear today its radio voices and its fake its just fake he wanted to make it easier for people to find real voices on the internet he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like ipods mr curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him no one did so he tried to write one himself he finished it a few months ago and says it totally sucked he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it the result is a work in progress called ipodder doug kaye a californiabased podcaster praises the former mtv vj for what he has done adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp player he explains people can wake up in the morning pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that theres all this new content automatically put onto their players it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia finland brazil even malaysia one couple broadcasts theirs the dawn and drew show from wisconsin in the us sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners  already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts  chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological knowhow to simply listen if i were to tell my mom or my motherinlaw to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator they would think i was speaking a foreign language mr mcintyre says along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the antiradio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is playboy for his part adam currys pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which he says is a badge ill wear with great honour to be the johnny carson or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful and you know what you dont need a hell of a lot of talent you just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine and thats good for me  clark boyd is technology correspondent for

artists to watch published at the start of last year scissor sisters franz ferdinand keane joss stone and mcfly were all in the sound of  top  the other five brits winners were already established before sound of  was compiled the ceremony will be televised on itv on thursday    im speechless best song of the last  years yeah right  i very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out like every track robbie has released as a single its a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before  give us a break  best song in  years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but really  listened to angels on radio  this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfection  as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last  years that deserve this award more its not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low  im actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last  years  what about the specials  ghost town the buzzcocks  ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays  kinky afro mcalmont  butler  yes joy division  love will tear us apart angels is middleoftheroad rubbish  angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap its musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result isnt very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music  best of the last  years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last  years after all  its alright for a pop song  but the best song of the last  years  there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last  yearsits a travesty  rubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio  but i dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last  years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out  where on earth did this dreadful list appear from  while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last  years should not include songs less than  years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show  youve got to be kidding  angels is a great song but not the best song of the last  years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits  i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i dont think its the best song from the past  years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place  he is alright but the song isnt that good im happy for robbie himself though  best song in the last  years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards  so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix still at least it wasnt will young  oh its all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even nonfans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent  i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and noone to slowdance with  i agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbie  i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isnt really that good a song it certainly isnt anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush  angels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers its a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups  robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late s and early s for example they werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think  yes angels is the best song since the past  years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning  ive always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british preteens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting its orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing  it is merely an irritating distraction  a wasp that refuses to go away on a summers afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it  you should feel ashamed of yourself  you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you  so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisss  angels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but  no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say  really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century  no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven yearold girl perhaps i mean will young come on  what a load of crap best song in the last  years  i dont think so what about all the real artists out there over the last  years  the list is endless but robbie williams doesnt even come close  what a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off why a halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past  years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up  why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last  years i think not i didnt realize radio  had so many listeners under the age of   people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last  years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here  the great british public at work again its a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted its not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nope  no because im not female and im not   ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past  years the shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is a joke  predictable and laughable  the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last  years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last  years  i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs  music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list  have radio  listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last  years than robbie williams ever will  no doubt about it theres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song  it should have been joy divisionthose guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in  years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today  yes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winner  i am astounded that such a secondrate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs its a terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music  the best song of the past  years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down  it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose its confirmed one thing  the british public are consistently dull  lt  no offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin  i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesnt deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust  obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it  if this is the best song of the last  years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record  a sad day for music  its not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people thats why it has been voted best song of the last  years its a good allrounder just like robbie  best song in  years since  im confused angels isnt a bad song its a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything its regressive bland even i suppose its just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become  granted angels is a good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition the queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for him  best song of the last  year,3
s what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasnt bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful  angels is without doubt a great song but i really dont think it deserves the title of best song in  yearsperhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song dont get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners  it would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with  people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob  i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past  years im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular  ive nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near us new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit  no surprise really its voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music  personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard  it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come  its an absolute joke however most of the original  were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise   the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of will young though  although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares  u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent  although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last  years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if thats all it means ,3

franz man seeks government help  franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion  for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he said  kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotlands role in making st century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent selfsufficient he said but socalled commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea  kapranos and his glasgow fourpiece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks brit awards including best group and best album their selftitled debut album won last years mercury music prize and spawned three top  singles he told the strong audience at the universitys reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm  he concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i dont really care about the brits he said its going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight  i think the government should do more to help upandcoming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels  rather than expecting the government  ie the taxpayer  to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in some of britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government funds  if they can fund football why not fund music  areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash  the government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multibillion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that  as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods  i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multimillion pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship  yes the government should fund music  it brings joy to the masses  there are already thousands of statefunded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use  as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idoltype funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about  only if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales  if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician the government shouldnt fund music  it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment  i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there  i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great deal  yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bandsartists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities  i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music  perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music  that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you like  though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privatelyfunded organizations like save the music in the us ,3

critics back aviator for oscars  martin scorseses the aviator will win best film at the oscars according to the uks leading movie critics  but several of those surveyed by the bbc news website think

rich pickings for hitech thieves  viruses trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change  the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home pcs viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code  the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package  you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to said pete simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in email message attachments its about outright criminality now said mr simpson explaining why this change has come about he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cashrich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order former virus writer marek strihavka aka benny from the a virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors not least said paul king principal security consultant at cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common in many ways the least likely way to do it is email because most of us have got antivirus and firewalls now he said few of the malicious programs written by hitech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data if you think of criminals they do not do clever said mr king they just do what works  as the tactics used by malicious programs change said mr king so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network  many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded as well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent the main motivation now is money said gary stowell spokesman for st bernard software mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high with almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover socalled spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine ,5
online games play with politics  after bubbling under for some time online games broke through onto the political arena in   the us presidential election provided a showcase for many aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of  the iowa game commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean more than  followed suit including frontrunner elections president forever and the political machine which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign including having to cope with the media others helped raise the stakes during the bushkerry contest by highlighting a candidates virtues or his vices  the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games a handful of multidiscipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers  when i started researching political games at the university about five years ago i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen said gonzalo frasca computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved added the uruguayanborn researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgamingcom the aim is to comment on international news events via games  the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way  video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation mr frasca told the bbc news website this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the countrys problems could be solved by working together its up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games ultimately dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs children learn a lot about the world through play there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up  but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns  this is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web only a few years ago most politicians did not have a webpage while now it is almost a musthave dr frasca said political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them it will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns ,5
china blocks google news site  china has been accused of blocking access to google news by the media watchdog reporters without borders  the parisbased pressure group said the englishlanguage news site had been unavailable for the past  days it said the aim was to force people to use a chinese edition of the site which according to the watchdog does not include critical reports google told the bbc news website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes  china is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world  a net police force monitors websites and emails and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information popular chinese portals such as sinacom and sohucom maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments and all  net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive  china is censoring google news to force internet users to use the chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports said the group in a statement by agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government google has let itself be used by beijing it said for its part the search giant said it was looking into the issue it appears that many users in china are having difficulty accessing google news sites in china and we are working to understand and resolve the issue said a google spokesperson google news gathers information from some  news sources headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm with no human editorial intervention it offers  editions of the service including one tailored for china and one for hong kong google launched a version in simplified chinese in september the site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information but google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within china as this would result in broken links ,5

apple laptop is greatest gadget  the apple powerbook  has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc  the  laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an alltime top  list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the  zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts andor electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a selfcontained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device  in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine  in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top  is the abacus which the magazine dates at  ad and put in th place other preelectronic gadgets in the top  include the sextant from  th position the marine chronometer from  nd position and the kodak brownie camera from  th position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top  which also includes the first flash mp player diamond multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number  in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number   sonys third entry in the top  is the cdp cd player from  who can forget the crystalline hissfree blast of madonnas like a virgin emanating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elseners knife the swiss army knife from  is at number  in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone rd the nintendo gameboy th and the pulsar quartz digital watch th the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser th s toy tamagotchi th and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler th  almost everyone has a mobile phone how many people own a powerbook or an ipod the findings of this magazine are not very convincing  what about the magnetic compass we still use it  years after it was invented  i am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc flash mp portable cd players etc are really just improvements in technology  my favourite true gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee  calm down its only in their opinion and any list that includes the taser in the top  gadgets has to be suspect  swiss army knife and no question about it how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as usefulpopular you dont need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out  this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair whilst the americans focus on apple tv remotes and tivo which probably is rather obscure in europe  what about the soda stream this gadget changed my preteen life lap tops may enable you to think different but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy  how about astro wars one of the pioneers for computer games i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today however tried it the other day and it was rubbish still a great gadget of its time  why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pdas  laptops etc  what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for its time a technological marvel  sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it  a laptop computer is not a gadget its a working tool  the sinclair executive was the worlds first pocket calculator i think this should be there as well  how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors  are the people who created this list insane  surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker  an interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early s blessed the original noteboook pc  the tandy  the size of a paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible  whats an apple powerbook   its out of date  not much of a gadget surely it has to be something simple  timeless  the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves   it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in  a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off  all top  are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current hightech obsession than anything else i say this as the swiss army knife only made no   sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with a true multitakings os shame the marketing was so bad  apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else  utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition  id also put apples newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason i only wish that vulcan incs flipstart wasnt just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs  the swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget i got mine  years ago still wearing and using it a lot it stood the test of time  psion organiser series  should be up there had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge  a first i think great product innovation  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers oferr mobile pc why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site its obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that  the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices  the psion series c the first most practical way to carry all your info around  i too would back the sinclair spectrum  without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now  id have put the mobile phone high up the list probably a nokia model  sinclair spectrum  k it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and thats what i do for a living now  i wish more modern notebooks  even apples newest offerings  were more like the pb particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses theyre invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use  congratulations to apple a deserved win ,5

blogs take on the mainstream  web logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow  these online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eyewitness account of events most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics the most wellknown examples include iraqi salam paxs accounts of the usled war former iranian vicepresident mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republics government and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign there are already websites pulling together these firsthand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinewscom launched last november  the blogging movement has been building up for many years  andrew nachison director of the media center a usbased thinktank that studies media technology and society highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before he says and blogs were a key part of that transformation among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying we are sorry for george w bushs victory and the responses from his supporters mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers tv and radio we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas he told the bbc news website but they followed the story they didnt lead it  some parts of the socalled traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs  others like the french newspaper le monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content i dont think the mission and role of journalism is threatened it is in transition as society itself is in transition says mr nachison however he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper the onetomany road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse says mr nachison the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides whats acceptable for public consumption and what isnt thats gone forever with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories  it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger  but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the socalled blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels tools such as googles blogger movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog us research thinktank pew internet  american life says a blog is created every  seconds although less than  of the total are updated at least once every two months but experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other said mr nachison and theres going to be bad that comes with the good ,5

cabs collect mountain of mobiles  gadgets are cheaper smaller and more common than ever but that just means we are more likely to lose them  in london alone over the past six months more than  mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs according to a survey that works out at about three phones per cab over the same period almost  laptops and  pdas such as palms and pocket pcs were left in licensed cabs even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets jemima khan reportedly left her ipod phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be hugh grant as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown and we trust more of our lives to them we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers the numbers of lost laptops has leapt by  in the last three years  this has left londoners or those travelling by cab in the capital as the worlds best at losing laptops according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec a mobiledata backup firm more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities helsinki oslo munich paris stockholm copenhagen chicago and sydney where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out by contrast danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in germans norwegians and swedes top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data  enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else  equally phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap oldfashioned phone to replace the tiny shiny expensive one they have just lost britons growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen according to statistics  of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as transport for london regularly consult it when trying to reunite folk with their phones and other gadgets for the drivers finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found the survey of what else has been left behind included a harp a dog a hamster and a baby ,5

court mulls filesharing future  judges at the us supreme court have been hearing evidence for and against filesharing networks  the court will decide whether producers of filesharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue filesharers could deter innovation they also said that filetrading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy  the lawsuit brought by  of the worlds largest entertainment firms has raged for several years legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue filetrading firms into bankruptcy but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus  the filesharers at the centre of the case  are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of filesharing providers instead they would have to pursue individuals who use peertopeer networks to get their hands on free music and movies the hitech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue intel filed a document with the supreme court earlier this month in defence of grokster and others despite misgivings about some aspects of the filesharing community it summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products are essentially tools that like any other tools capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes  asking firms to secondguess the uses that its technologies would be put to and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use would stifle innovation it said the electronic frontier foundation a civil rights watchdog is also defending streamcast networks the company behind the morpheus filesharing software the case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation it said it cites as do many the landmark ruling in  which found that sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its betamax video recorder could be used for piracy defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peertopeer networks upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case a small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered wearing save betamax tshirts the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past  years said gary shapiro chief executive of the consumer electronics association supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apples ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had on balance been beneficial to society he said that while filetrading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music conceptually the technology had some really excellent uses  based on tuesdays hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but filesharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy groksters lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up but this argument was dismissed as ridiculous by justice david souter cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year its about preserving americas proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology he said the case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peertopeer networks they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs filesharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software government documents and promotional copies of music ,5

the force is strong in battlefront  the warm reception that has greeted star wars battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its backtobasics approach and immense nostalgia quotient  geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of allout gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchises extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves  the sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or firstperson perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the players personal propensity for good or evil  there is ample chance to be a wookie shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a firedup luke skywalker in each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet it really is no more complicated than that locations include the frozen wastes of hoth the ice planet from the empire strikes back complete with massive mechanical atats on the march there are also the dusty sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis as well as the forest moon of endor where return of the jedis muchmaligned ewoks lived the feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic it is worth noting though that on the playstation  the games graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version the pivotal element behind battlefronts success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of largescale war the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over  speaking of noise battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxys audio motifs  the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long the gameplay is reliable bogstandard stuff short on originality there are also odd annoyances like the games insistence on respawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be that said it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike however non userfriendly they prove whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game the aboveaverage ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated battlefronts novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty onetrickpony of a game but for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas stable ,5

graphics card with  ram on board plus tv out a  gb hard drive cdwriter and dvd player windows xp home  anything else youre building it so you have to buy all the software you want to install and do your own troubleshooting and tech support building your own machine is easier than it used to be but you need to read specifications carefully to make sure all parts work together  experienced and keen pc users building your own pc or upgrading the one you have is a great way to improve your understanding of how it all works  its cheap you can specify exactly what you want and you get the thrill of putting it together yourself and a bigger thrill if everything works as it should  once its built you wont be able to do much with it until you start buying software for it if it starts to go wrong it might take a lot of fixing as gavin cox of the excellent buildyourownorguk website put it it will be tough to obtainbuild a pc to ever be as compact and charming as the mac mini  performancewise its not cutting edge and is barely entrylevel by todays market but up against the mac mini i believe it will hold its own and even pull a few more tricks says gavin cox the good news is that the machine is eminently expandable by contrast says mr cox the mac mini is almost disposable ,5
virus poses as christmas email  security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card  the zafid virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected email antivirus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online antivirus firm sophos said that  of the email currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus  like many other windows viruses zafid plunders microsoft outlook for email addresses and then uses mailsending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug the attachment on the email poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces  the virus subject line says merry christmas and translates this into one of  languages depending of the final suffix of the email address the infected message has been sent to the message in the body of the email reads happy holidays and this too is translated on infected machines the virus tries to disable antivirus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america italy spain bulgaria and hungary the original zafi virus appeared in april this year we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards and we recommend this to all our clients too said mikko hypponen who heads fsecures antivirus team ,5
antitremor mouse stops pc shakes  a special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed  the device uses similar steady cam technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition said the uk national tremor foundation using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so were delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem said karen walsh from the uk national tremor foundation most commonly associated with tremors is parkinsons disease but they can also be caused by other conditions like essential tremor et tremors more often affect older people but can hit all ages et for example is genetic and can afflict people throughout their lives  the assistive mouse adapter ama is the brainchild of ibm researcher jim levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle who has parkinsons disease struggle with mouse control i knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world including the elderly  the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages and at the same time the need for computer access grows he said computer users plug the device into a pc and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is it is also able to recognise multiple clicking on a mouse button caused by shaky digits ibm said it would partner up with a small ukbased electronics firm montrose secam to produce the devices which will cost about  james cosgrave one of the companys directors said it would make a big difference to those with tremors im a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane he said but using a pc has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen he said a prototype of the gadget had transformed his life  the device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier last year the office for national statistics reported that for the first time more than half of all households in britain had a home computer with prices getting cheaper to get online too computer ownership is increasing but although  of british people have tried the internet only  of britons aged  or over have been online more than six million uk households now have a broadband net by the middle of  it is estimated that  of all uk net users will be on broadband there are still millions using the net through dialup connections too ,5

digital guru floats sub pc  nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mits media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than    he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries he said one laptop per child could be  very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood he said the child could use the laptop like a text book he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linuxbased operating system we have to get the display down to below  to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel  the second trick is to get rid of the fat  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money in  mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on  while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops we put in  laptops three years ago  only one has been broken the kids cherish these things its also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious nokia make  million cell phones a year so for us to claim were going to make  million laptops is a big number but were not talking about doing it in three or five years were talking about months he plans to be distributing them by the end of  and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order in china they spend  per child per year on textbooks thats for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away ,5
pompeii gets digital makeover  the oldfashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computergenerated images that bring the site to life  a european unionfunded project is looking at providing tourists with computeraugmented versions of archaeological attractions it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism  the technology would allow digital people and other computergenerated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site  the lifeplus project is part of the eus information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting userfriendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage engineers and researchers working in the europewide consortium have come up with a prototype augmentedreality system it would require the visitor to wear a headmounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitors viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements at pompeii for example the visitor would not just see the frescos taverns and villas that have been excavated but also people going about their daily life augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming  this technology can now be used for much more than just computer games said professor nadia magnenatthalman of the swiss research group miralab  we are for the first time able to run this combination of software processes to create walking talking people with believable clothing skin and hair in realtime she said unlike virtual reality which delivers an entirely computergenerated scene to the viewer the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitors view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements the software capable of doing this has been developed by a uk company d andrew stoddart chief scientist at d said that the eu project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life the popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computergenerated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life he said ,5

media gadgets get moving  pocketsized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in  according to industry experts  last year saw the emergence of portable media players such as the windowsbased creative zen portable media player the samsung yepp the iriver pmc and the archos av series among others but this year they are set to get smarter and more connected to allow people to find more video to watch on them archos launched its latest range of its linuxbased portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday dubbed the pocket media assistant pma it crucially has wifi capability builtin for the first time consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access said henri crohas chief of archos and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in peoples pockets after the mobile  unlike windowsbased players the archos av series devices have always been able to record from any video source such as tvs as well as playback the content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device  recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it and wifi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a highspeed wireless link archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces primarily for us consumers though it has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company tivo which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windowsbased portable media players or smartphones it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central vh and country music tv on its devices and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices but the ability to record directly from tv vcr and digital cable and satellite boxes which windowsbased devices do not offer certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too  the increased capability of these devices and the content deals that are being done may go some way to persuading people to use them recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music only  of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move more seemed interested in spending their cash on musiconly devices  this year we are ready for an explosion of portable media microsofts mike coleman told the bbc news website we are very bullish about it the fact that i can put photos on here too and share them is supercool to the consumer he added the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too there is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work although microsofts content distribution deals are for the us market at the moment talks were always ongoing with european content suppliers to offer similar services various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices particularly via those which are wifi enabled the possibility is open for nonprofessional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work ces which runs from  to  january showcases more than  new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in  ,5

kenyan school turns to handhelds  at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus  they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get uptodate information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the nongovernmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called eslates the eslates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver the data is transmitted alongside audio signals the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld eslates it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it it also stores this on its hard disc  the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project its very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but its also a oneway connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult  the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linuxbased system the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions users can scroll through these sections independently of each other eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the worlds largest university libraries all books in the public domain something like  million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the eslates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the eslates says the projects ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting  as they need it most ,5

bush website blocked outside us  surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official reelection site of president george w bush  the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp  the international exclusion zone around georgewbushcom was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites netcraft said that since the early hours of  october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney failed  by contrast netcrafts four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis on  october the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors mike prettejohn president of netcraft speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the runup to the election on  november he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign however simply blocking nonus visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites ,5
football manager scores big time  for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager cm indeed it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs  however last year was the final time that developers sports interactive si and publishers eidos would work together they decided to go their separate ways and each kept a piece of the franchise si kept the games code and database and eidos retained rights to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game so at the beginning of this year fans faced a new situation eidos announced the next cm game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst si developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers sega under the name football manager so what does this mean well football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series and it has been released earlier than expected at this point cm looks like it will ship early next year but given that football manager  is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape up  a game like fm could blind you with statistics it has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans but that does not do justice to the game really what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth  you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance england and scotland that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south of course you might be looking for european glory or to get hold of abramovichs millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan  the list goes on a very long way once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you sometimes it is promotion or a place in europe sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle it might even be a case of champions or else obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having a look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it then bring on the matches which are once more available in the everimproving top down d view with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed  however there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well  things like the manager mindgames which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses the match engine is also much improved and it is more of a joy than ever to watch in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience  with a game that is so complex and so openended there are of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area and a sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybodys satisfaction but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay and if there are problems further down the line sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible in all there are many more tweaks and improvements if you were a fan of the previous cm games then fm might make you forget there was anything else before it if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership spurs into europe or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree fm could be the best purchase you ever made just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas  football manager  out now for the pc and the mac ,5
search wars hit desktop pcs  another front in the ongoing battle between microsoft and google is about to be opened  by the end of  microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a pc hard drive the move is in answer to googles release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop pcs the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as google aol yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files  microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results john connors microsofts chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year  were going to have a heck of a great race in search between google microsoft and yahoo he said its going to be really fun to follow microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users the program could be based on the software microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of lookout software in early october on  october google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a pc and lets users use one tool to find email messages spreadsheets text files and presentations the software will also find webpages and messages sent via aol instant messenger  many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too companies such as blinkx copernic enfish x technologies and xfriend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer  apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the tiger operating system due to follow are net giants aol and yahoo the latter recently bought stata labs to get its hands on search software that people can use microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of windows codenamed longhorn however this is not likely to appear until  the recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keywordbased web search said kathy rittweger cofounder of blinkx finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist  desktop search has become important for several reasons according to research by message analysts the radicati group up to  of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in email messages and attachments jf sullivan spokesman for email software firm sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work the key thing is being able to manage all this information he said also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online for companies such as google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money but this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools ,5
satellite mapping aids darfur relief  aid workers trying to house feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology  a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps the aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks for the rivers and for the villages to more largescale maps useful for very general planning purposes said einar bjorgo from unosat the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium  the group uses satellites from nasa the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations from there the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data you have to convert the data into images then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis damage or situation maps said stefan voigt who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations the german aerospace centre  this kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but respond gets it done in about  hours our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery reading satellite maps so its our task to transfer the data into information that nontechnical people can read and understand easily and very very efficiently said mr voigt respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web and on compact disc but the best map is one you can hold in your hands especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce a map is a working document explains herbert hansen of responds belgian partner keyobs you need to use it you need to write on it correct give feedback and so on so you need paper to write on we print maps we laminate the maps we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map its completely protected  humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of responds maps they have come in especially handy during sudans rainy season when normally dry riverbeds or wadis became flooded these wadis had a very small amount of flooding generally in terms of depth but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit responds rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and ontheground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbhboston coproduction ,5
gritty return for prince of persia  still basking in the relatively recent glory of last years sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in a more bellicose mood than last time  this sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence as before you control the superathletic prince from a thirdperson perspective the timetravelling plot hinges on the dahaka an allconsuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beasts creation  studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to oldfashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be ever since the series thengroundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulouslyanimated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts  those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill until you reach that point it is a haphazard business all too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before the games developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off  warrior within is a very slick package the games intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences  it is on a par with the jawdropping opening sequence of onimusha  earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anticlimax that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game the music is probably the worst aspect  a meritfree heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for ,5

gamers could drive highdefinition  tv films and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens  it is called highdefinition  hd for short  and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us it is set according to analysts to do for images what cds did for sound different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive but europes gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand europeans will have to wait until at least  until they see mainstream hdtv  to view it it needs to be transmitted in hd format and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the highquality resolution the next generation of consoles however are expected to start appearing at the end of  start of  and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such highresolution pictures in the next generation of consoles hd support is mandatory dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website every game is going to be playable in hd so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs and who have no content to watch are going to be blown away by these really highdetail pictures its going to change really the way they look at gaming  at the end of last year chris deering sonys european president made a prediction that  million european households would have hdtv sets by  a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at  million by  an increase from an estimated  sets at the end of  but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology  about   if there are few programmes or films to watch on them satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in  and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by   until broadcast rights format standards  and the practicalities of updating equipment  are agreed tv content will be limited all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen and scan lines which go down the screen most standard uk tv pictures are made up of  lines and about  pixels hd offers up to  active lines with each line made up of  pixels this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv probably in the uk gaming is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off as in look what this tv can do until hd is really adopted by broadcasters explains dr tuffy but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics and more immersive gaming experiences they are used to spending money on hardware to match a games requirements demographics have changed too and the sweet spot for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late s this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of bigscreen highdefinition display technologies and hd projectors earlier than others  higher capacity storage discs such as hddvd and blueray  are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles  allowing developers more room for detailed graphics  for console developers though hd offers some production changes it could make games production slightly more expensive thinks dr tuffy but we may see the crossplatform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console he says you are literally going to get to the point with a lord of the rings game for example is going to be closer and closer to the actual film especially the cgi stuff from the dvd and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game just now they have almost got it seamless with hd he says the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the bigscreen cinema release this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide at that point says dr tuffy games could become more or less interactive movies ,5
movie body hits peertopeer nets  the movie industry has struck out at filesharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the us  the motion picture association of america mpaa also said it had succeeded in getting a network called lokitorrent closed down it is the latest network which uses the peertopeer system called bittorrent to be hit by the mpaa the mpaa began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in december a dallas court agreed that hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to lokitorrents server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally in october  the site had provided links to more than  files the action came after the operators of lokitorrent agreed a settlement with the mpaa a stark message has appeared on the site from the mpaa warning you can click but you cant hide in bittorrent systems server sites do not host the files being shared they host links called trackers that direct people to others that have it instead  as well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the us the mpaa said it had given operators that host edonkey servers take down notices hollywood studios are aggressively clamping down on filesharers who it says infringe copyright laws by copying films and tv programmes then share the files online but it is now targeting the operators of bittorrent networks themselves it has filed  lawsuits against operators of bittorrent server sites since december the strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt filesharers ability to swap content using bittorrent systems the film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and dvds already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal filesharing is adding to their losses in december the legal action claimed its most highprofile victim the popular suprnovaorg website was forced to close and others like phoenix torrent followed soon after ,5

eu software patent law faces axe  the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented  politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially redrafted or even scrapped the bill was backed by some hitech firms saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile  hugo lueders european director for public policy at comptia an umbrella organization for technology companies said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement the proposed law had a troubled passage through the european parliament its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee juri said the law should be redrafted after it failed to win the support of meps to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for reconsideration ,5
mac mini heralds mini revolution  the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month but does the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things dealt with at the outset  yes the mac mini is really really small and yes it is another piece of inspired apple design there is more to be said on the computers size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer inside that small box there is a g processor a cddvd player a hard drive some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system a dvd burner wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost and if you do not have a monitor keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also  it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under  you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications  apple software the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x the operating system as well as ilife  a suite of software which includes itunes web browser safari iphoto garage band and idvd i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x  of course users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs for people who want to do interesting things with their music photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer its a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses said mark sparrow technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine he added in essence its a laptop in a biscuit tin minus the screen and the keyboard the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technicallysavvy to experiment with their macs one user has already created a dock to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car  the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for incar entertainment  playing movies and music  as well as navigation another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre  ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes music films and photos  partly due to its small living room friendly design but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case  at least not in the here and now the hard drive  at gb for the larger model  is too small to be realistically used as media centre  while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content a media centre computer has to store music files and photos and as such gb just seems too small most pcs running windows media center have at least gb hard disks coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is not what it is not but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses so  is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing graham barlow editor of mac format understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint its just a mac but we should be very excited  its revolutionary in its size smaller than pcs looks looks better than pcs and the fact that its the first mac designed to really go for the lowcost pc market the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland bulky boxes there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on miniitx motherboards but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the homebuild enthusiast or expensive prebuilt options based around microsofts media center software but for the value the mac mini offers bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before apple is to be congratulated let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution  it is a mini revolution ,5
smart search lets art fans browse  if you dont know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting  artgarden developed by bts research unit is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works  the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection it chooses a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them so for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement th century and water a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tates digital programme for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didnt have a clue what i wanted he said the textbased search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead  he thinks the dominance of textbased searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object you dont arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldnt have asked for he said the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films ,5
format wars could confuse users  technology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video  the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy  currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an ownbrand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium  the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research the difference is that it is very fragmented he said its not a twohorse race its a five six seven or even eighthorse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families although initiatives such as microsofts plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come  shelley taylor analyst and author of a report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers apples itunes service was a perfect example of this she said although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said  she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now  according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of filesharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop people want portability she said and with peertopeer they have  portability cory doctorow european coordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyberrights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over  consumers the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again  the ipod version the auto version the american and uk version the ringtone version and so on ,5
toxic web links help virus spread  virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares  a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code those clicking on the poisoned links in email messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by antivirus software that combs through code contained in email attachments  the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on  november they exploit a windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier  like many other recent viruses bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for email addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch email messages to potential victims but unlike many other recent viruses does not itself travel via mail instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that when clicked on connect back to the machine that distributed that email essentially bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a paypal transaction  copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading  clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the email messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread finnish antivirus firm fsecure said that so far it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation  tim warner spokesman for antivirus firm finjan said you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code most firms have secured their email gateway said mr warner but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims the bofra family of viruses which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug can infect machines running windows    me nt xp and server  users running windows xp that have applied the sp update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits ,5

norway upholds napster ruling  a norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable mp files has been ordered to pay compensation by the countrys supreme court  frank allan bruvik was ordered to pay  kroner  to the music industry in norway he was a student when he set up his napsterno site which allowed users to submit and receive links to mp files bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry music industry bosses in norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium  frank allan bruvik set up the napsterno website as part of a school project in  while studying computer engineering in the norwegian town of lillehammer the website was not associated with the napstercom site in the usa which had been operating since  and was already facing legal action  bruviks site was online between august and november  and while it did not host any music at its peak it was providing links to more than  free files on other servers as well as providing links the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors a legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including norways performing rights society tono and the norwegian branches of sony music and universal music who saw it as an important test of principle  a norwegian court ruled in  that bruvik would have to pay  kroner to the music industry but the countrys court of appeal cleared him saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music however the supreme court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law it added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act and that bruviks actions were premeditated norways music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling because showed that music piracy would not be accepted  meanwhile in the usa a further  lawsuits against people alleged to have traded copyrighted songs were filed this week by the recording industry association of america the suits brought on behalf of the major record companies cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peertopeer services such as kazaa and edonkey as with preceding cases the fresh action was made against socalled john doe defendants who are identified only by the codes given to their computers internet connections ,5
learning to love broadband  we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson  one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work i can sit in a caf or a library with or without a wifi connection and research and write articles if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne a childrens writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection  we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dialup connection on her daughters laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dialup  she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively but the impact spread into her personal life too she did not take her children to the cinema during halfterm because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website and she did not know where to go fossilhunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found a book on fossils but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things she may be unusual but i do not think anne is alone  according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april  and numbers are climbing fast there will certainly be five million by the end of the year dialup users are switching to broadband my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason  it is part of the process of adaptation and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient it may not be the brave new world of streaming fullscreen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now and it is certainly better than slow access or no access just ask anne  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital ,5
millions to miss out on the net  by   of the uks population will still be without internet access at home says a study  around  million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant bt it compares to  million or  of the uk who are not currently online the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is wishful thinking the report concludes  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts  the gap between havenets and havenots has been much talked about but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more userfriendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it said adrian hosford director of corporate responsibility at bt costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological there is a hard rump of havenots who are not engaging with the net they dont have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits said mr hosford  as now the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families the older generation and the disabled  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital havenots the disabled will make up  and the elderly nearly a third by  the report forecasts organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem said mr hosford the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs explained mr hosford such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome he said if we dont address this problem now it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs education opportunities will be limited and theyll simply not be able to keep up with society he said the alliance for digital inclusion an independent body with members drawn from government industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks ,5
intel unveils laser breakthrough  intel has said it has found a way to put a siliconbased laser on a chip raising hopes of much faster networks  scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade  weve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intels photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia  and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang  show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it  telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these lightmoving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in highvolume manufacturing have been solved were trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easytomake filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semiconductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses its a technical validation that it can work he said ,5
format wars could confuse users  technology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video  the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy  currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an ownbrand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium  the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research the difference is that it is very fragmented he said its not a twohorse race its a five six seven or even eighthorse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families although initiatives such as microsofts plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come  shelley taylor analyst and author of a report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers apples itunes service was a perfect example of this she said although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said  she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now  according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of filesharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop people want portability she said and with peertopeer they have  portability cory doctorow european coordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyberrights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over  consumers the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again  the ipod version the auto version the american and uk version the ringtone version and so on ,5

slow start to speedy net services  faster broadband in the uk is becoming a reality as more internet providers offer superfast services  some lucky britons can already take advantage of uk onlines  megabits per second service which was launched in november  bt retail has announced that it will trial the same speed service with a national rollout by year end other service providers are expected to follow suit and a glut of new voice and video services will follow  if the bandwidth is there then isps will buy it said jill finger a research director at analyst firm idc others will be watching bt retails trials which is initially for employees and later in the summer for customers with interest for bt retail she said the superfast service could be a way of differentiating it from other players it has been losing market share and this could be one way of gaining some of that back said ms finger wanadoo is set to trial an mbps service in the summer and also plans to roll out unbundled services  which means it takes over the network from bt  which will provide speeds of up to mbps there is no timetable for this at the moment cable firms ntl and telewest are also bound to increase bandwidth at some time in the future and according to an ntl spokesman are in a better position than bt in the long term bts network is limited compared to that of cable with all the other services coming on stream such as video on demand the question is will mbps be enough he asked ,5
china to overtake us net use  the chinese netusing population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years says a report  chinas net users number m but this represents less than  of the countrys  billion people market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the  million us users of the net by  the report says that the countrys culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations  already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations said william makower chief executive of panlogic in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare this combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china only  of chinese homes have telephones according to reports net usage tends to happen in the evening said mr makower they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf its fundamentally different usage to what we have here he said  net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the countrys eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends said mr makower many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life for instance said mr makower credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt the most popular way to pay is cashondelivery he said and thats quite a brake to the development of ecommerce the arrival of foreign banks in china due in  could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said mr makower but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar he said generally its more difficult for the government to be able to control it its real value is as an open window onto whats happening elsewhere in the world he said government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet its a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it said mr makower ,5
no half measures with halflife   could halflife  possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays its safe to say that this is the most highlyanticipated computer game of all time  fortunately it doesnt merely live up to its promise but exceeds it noone who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped all the money  or indeed time  is on the screen the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original  halflife having survived that skirmish in an desolate monsterinfested research facility hes back in another foreboding troublespot  the enigmatic city  it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city but as soon as your train pulls in to the station its clear that all is not well here sinister police patrol the unkempt streets and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be  you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedomfighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task it is not immediately explained what your objectives are nor precisely why everything is so ravaged finding out stepbystep is all part of the experience although you never fully get to understand what it was all about that does not really matter hl does not waste energy blinding you with plot underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective and immerses the player in the most vivid convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen there are no cutscenes to interrupt the flow exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you  whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a topnotch theme park thrillride wandering through halflifes world truly does feel like being part of a movie  considering its sophistication the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pcs components this is it on our test machine  an alienware system with an athlon  processor and atis radeon x video card  everything ran at full quality without trouble and the visual experience was simply jawdropping it is not simply that the surfaces textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them the haunting grim landscapes become strangely beautiful luckily you get time to pause midtask and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings so impressive are the physics that youll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move there are puzzles to be solved along the way pitched at about the right difficulty but most progress is achieved by force freeman is quickly reunited with the original games famous crowbar and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow  virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with and in realistic fashion you will be wowed by the attentiontodetail as you chip bits of plaster off walls chase a pigeon out of your way or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed at times halflife  feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome running around on foot is great enough but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles in gameplay terms hl somehow gets almost everything perfect and without resorting to the zombiesleapingoutofshadows approach of doom iii its all incredibly unsettling the vacant environment is distinctly eerie and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside  the game does have a couple of problems firstly the carefullyscripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people  a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue which makes for exciting moments but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once youve completed it if you like things openended and freeranging far cry will be a lot more pleasing but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run installing it proved a lifedraining siege that would test a saints patience developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy the box does warn you of this antipiracy measure but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed the temperamental valve servers and the time of day but it can take hours it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances  but luckily halflife  is up to the challenge it is surely the best thing in its genre and possibly many will feel of any genre the bar has been raised and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future  halflife  is out now for the pc ,5

mobile networks seek turbo boost  thirdgeneration mobile g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services  that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the gsm world congress in cannes last week fast g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association at gsm siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second  up to  times faster than current g networks the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access a highspeed high bandwidth technology available now early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than  kilobits per second kbps on standard g networks  highspeed downlink packet access hsdpa  sometimes called super g  will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by ukbased research consultancy analysys a number of companies are developing the technology nokia and canadabased wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers  while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in widearea networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of g with hsdpa and other enhancements the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic wcdma g he added motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor g cell using a single hsdpa device but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised evdo  us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its g network at the end of last year we are expanding our network and deploying evdo technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprints vice president for technology development when the contract was announced as part of bn in multiyear contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around bn on evdo technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of  megabits a second and peak download rates of mbps mmo the ukbased operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on hsdpa using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of mbps from next summer on its isle of man g network and will eventually support speeds of up to mbps us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson  siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in  the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of  siemens  in collaboration with the fraunhofer germansino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology  has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band the speeds offered by g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for g licences but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dialup phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of  megabits a second  much faster than g this means users are likely to find g disappointing unless the networks are souped up if they arent those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multipleantennae devices and conduct field trials a commercial system could be as far away as  though siemens did not rule out an earlier date ,5

rolling out next generations net  the body that oversees how the net works grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last  years but it is just the start  in a sense we have hardly started in reaching the whole population the new chair of the internet engineering task force ietf brian carpenter says the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the nets architecture with broadband takeup growing services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net i think voip voiceover internet protocol allowing phone calls to be made over the net is very important  it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms says dr carpenter second it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure with voip you need very little infrastructure  a distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent  years at cern the european laboratory for particle physics as the new chair of the ietf his next big challenge is overseeing ipv the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web at cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web so he is wellplaced to take on such a task the nets growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work are open and free for anyone to use and work with  the net is built on a protocol called tcpip which means transmission control protocol and internet protocol when computers communicate with the net a unique ip address is used to send and receive information the ietf is a large international community of network designers operators vendors and researchers working on the evolution of the nets architecture and the way this information is sent and received they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps weve seen some interesting effects over last few years explains dr carpenter the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the s then there was a bit of a glitch in  we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth  that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies like china which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies the number of broadband subscribers via dsl digital subscriber line doubled in a year to  million according to figures released at the end of  the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate explained dr carpenter given it the net was designed for the whole community it has done well to reach millions if you want to reach the whole population you have to make sure it can scale up ipv the standard that will replace the existing ipv will allow for billions more addresses on the net and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world the actual number of addresses with ipv is limited to four billion ip addresses that clearly is not enough when you have  billion people to serve so there is technical solution the new version of ip  ipv it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits said dr carpenter standards are vital to something as complex as the net and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task the difference this next generation standard ipv will make to the average net user is almost invisible our first goal is that it ipv should make no difference  people should not notice a difference it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer a lot of the process will be invisible people are usually given an ip address without knowing it technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled said dr carpenter  the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security to dr carpenter the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour people have to be educated about sensible behaviour he says such as ignoring emails that claim you have won something  i dont think it is going to get worse people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do  just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards it is a neverending battle in a sense but he adds even if security has improved you still worry a bit unfortunately it is just part of life we have a duty to do what we can ,5
dvd copy protection strengthened  dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new antipiracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision  the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most but not all of the current dvd ripping copying programs used to pirate dvds ripguard is designed to reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer said the firm macrovision said the new technology will work in nearly all current dvd players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales  the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last  months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download  ultimately we see ripguard dvd evolving beyond antipiracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrows digital home and the upcoming highdefinition formats said steve weinstein executive vice president and general manager of macrovisions entertainment technologies group macrovision said ripguard was designed to plug the digital hole that was created by socalled decss ripper software it circumvents content scrambling system measures placed on dvds and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted dvds in minutes those copies could then be burned onto a blank dvd or uploaded for exchange to a peertopeer network macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against rent rip and return  where people would rent a dvd copy it and then return the original ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of  the company said the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs  if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anticopying measures ,5
games firms face tough future  uk video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles the industry warns  fred hasson head of tiga which represents independent developers said that more uk firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles three leading uk video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt microsoft sony and nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next  months microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that xbox  will be released in the us before the end of   the new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games mr hasson said in the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers he said there were about  independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities he said  mr hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines that figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the bbc news website  codemasters climax and rebellion  as consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost said gary dunn development director at codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles jason kingsley chief executive of rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger he added we have been through five technology transitions and survived so far each one has involved the death of some people all companies said they were investing in new tools  called middleware  in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control  simon gardner president of climaxs action studio said we are investing in superior tools and editors we are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams its vital we avoid huge teams he said climax was already directing about  of its resources to preparation for next generation titles mr dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming development and artistic talent if companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams at some point the talent is going to run out mr hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more businesslike there are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days some of them are still making games for peer group approval  that has to stop ,5

robotic pods take on car design  a new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyota  the companys vision for the single passenger in the st century involves the driver cruising by in a fourwheeled leaflike device or strolling along encased in an eggshaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet both these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the toyota stand at the expo  in aichi japan in march  the models are being positioned as socalled personal mobility devices which have few limits the open leaflike iunit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year built using environmentally friendly plantbased materials the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes the model allows the user to make tight onthespot turns move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music  also on display at the show will be the eggshaped ifoot this is a twolegged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick  standing at a height of well over seven feet  metres the unit can walk along at a speed of about kmh mph and navigate staircases into the bargain mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the birdlike legs that bend over backwards they are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university they clearly have eyecatching appeal which is in part the name of the game here and are linked to the imac and ipodtype niche which apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years  new different hitech image conscious products as always with these concept vehicles it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace  the personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities toyotas prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much us military research over the years and japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individuals particular mobility needs while toyotas prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility  experts though are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area  those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance now and certainly in the future are the elderly and infirm people dr gillingwater told the bbc news website you have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups design considerations also exist dr erel avineri of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled for example one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up it looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need this and other humanfactors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered said dr avineri in general introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation this may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle such singleperson vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport the concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions said dr gillingwater whats their range how userfriendly will they really be what infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used overall i think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions ,5
eu software patent law delayed  controversial new eu rules for the patenting of computerbased inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from poland  poland  a large and therefore crucial eu member  has requested more time to consider the issue especially as it relates to the patenting of software critics say the law would favour large companies over small innovative ones they say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software  polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computerimplemented inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software the planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the eu should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the us so for instance usbased amazoncom holds a patent on oneclick shopping critics claim the law which the eu says is needed to harmonise with the us is little more than a law on ideas patent rights it is claimed protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected eva lichtenberg a austrian green member of the european parliament said in a statement smaller innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them she added the european parliament has already clashed with the european union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic the directive has been subject to several previous delays ,5
mobiles get set for visual radio  the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but  could see another big innovation that wont just see a change in our mobile phone habits  it might alter the way we listen to the radio finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested  the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day  one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius a senior project manager at nokia was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium he said im very happy to say its not television what were talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today if you have a visual radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you dont know or theres a competition or vote that youd like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the onair broadcast youve just been listening to  that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in a similar way to digital televisions red button content  possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a realtime basis this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners  as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network and there will be a cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact itll be two or three pounds per month said mr wasenius but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dialup connections one thing that is for sure  assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be  million visual radioenabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of  basically visual radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before  the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners station manager steve taylor commented listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like mp music downloads and the latest gig tickets initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon  the  and   but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them  listen again to the interview on the radio five live website ,5

fileswappers ready new network  legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down  one site behind the success of the bittorrent fileswapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies  in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised that filesharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnovaorg which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to  now the man behind suprnovaorg who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new fileswapping network dubbed exeem in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa filesharing systems like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone there will be no centrally maintained list this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users an early public version of the software should be available before february sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development there were no plans for a linux or mac version he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program despite suprnova administrator slonceks involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis  users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream  dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peertopeer networks said exeem was the next evolution in filesharing systems but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared exeem cannot prevent pollution he said the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one thats full of crap like kazaa he said there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said mr pouwelse said that future versions of filesharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic its hard to compete with free he said noone from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the filesharing development ,5

online commons to spark debate  online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research ippr  existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the thinktank although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate in its report is online community a policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities adopting an ebaytype model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection what we are proposing is a civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication  like a prelegislation discussion  the idea of a civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of edemocracy at the oxford internet institute the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist it mentions goodpractice public initiatives like the bbcs ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues  but he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peertopeer interaction online at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each others reputation by how they treat other members using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built this could mean a civic commons would work within a nonmarket system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publiclyrecognised rules  egovernment initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues  with  of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic nonmarket interactions said mr davies there is a role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added the paper is part of the ipprs digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain ,5

pc photo printers challenge pros  home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from high street developers tests shows  a survey carried out by pc pro magazine looked at which of  home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab the tests found that images from top pc printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs but using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months warned the magazine  the group test of  home photo printers for pcs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as high street names such as jessops boots and snappy snaps the comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage it found that although some ink for printers now costs more than  per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a high street store if you really like your photos then its definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street but only if you choose the right printer said nick ross top tester at pc pro  mr ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many high street developers or even some professional wedding photographers some high street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were xin said mr ross but the test revealed that images xin and xin in size were cheaper to produce at home according to pc pro producing a print xin on an epson r printer using top quality paper costs  at jessops the same image would cost  and at snappy snaps  a xin snap at boots would cost  considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the high street and how silverhalide prints can fade in the sun were adamant that its now better cheaper and more convenient to print at home he said ann simpson marketing manager at snappy snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one she said many people are not skilled at getting the colour contrast and cropping right and they dont want the hassle she added the magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading it recommended avoiding socalled thirdparty inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest ,5

evil twin fear for wireless net  people using wireless highspeed net wifi are being warned about fake hotspots or access points  the latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say cranfield university experts once logged onto an evil twin sensitive data can be intercepted wifi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability london leads the global wifi hotspots league with more than  the number of hotspots is expected to reach  by  according to analysts users need to be wary of using their wifi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature said professor brian collins head of information systems at cranfield university  users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wifi device has its security measures activated he added bt openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wifi secure naturally people may have security concerns said chris clark chief executive for bts wireless broadband  but wifi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dialup he said bt openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot this means that users personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure said mr clark  in the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said dr nobles cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin cybercriminals dont have to be that clever to carry out such an attack said dr phil nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency  although wifi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use highspeed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a companys computer system public wifi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use but many home and company wifi networks are left unprotected and can be sniffed out and hijacked by anyone with the correct equipment bt advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly said mr clark we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museums dana centre in london on thursday ,5

cable offers videoondemand  cable firms ntl and telewest have both launched videoondemand services as the battle between satellite and cable tv heats up  movies from sony pictures walt disney touchstone miramax columbia and buena vista will be among those on offer the service is similar to sky plus as users can pause fast forward and rewind content but they cannot store programmes on their set top box  yet it could sound the death knell for some tv channels telewest predicts it allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over sky for the first time in many years said telewest chief executive eric tveter  videoondemand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on tv there will be less compromising around the tv schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside said philip snalune director of products at telewest telewest customers in bristol and ntl viewers in glasgow will be the first to test the new service which sees a raft of movies on offer for  hour rental during the year the service will be extended to all cable regions films will range in price from  or  for archived movies to  for current releases new releases initially on offer will include  first dates kill bill volume  gothika and the station agent in addition ntl is offering childrens programmes adult content music video and concerts telewest will launch similar services later in the year ntl is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed its pick of the week service will offer a selection of bbc programmes from the previous seven days such as eastenders casualty top gear and antiques roadshow the bbc is trialling a similar service offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their pc for telewest it is the beginning of a m investment in tvondemand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder pvr pvr has been a big success for sky because it gives customers control over programmes satellite customers without pvr cannot pause rewind or fast forward their programmes  with both services on offer from telewest mr tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial tv but also gain a huge competitive advantage over sky  we offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both videoondemand and pvr he said video rental stores may also have to watch their back videoondemand is better than having a videostore in your living room and is more convenient he said ntl said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a pvr but for the moment is concentrating on videoondemand pvr is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand said a spokesman for the company videoondemand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate settop box or extra remote controls he added adam thomas an analyst at research firm informa media believes the time is ripe for videoondemand to flourish while sky will remain the dominant force in uk pay tv for some time to come ntl and telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of vod enthusiasm and if marketed correctly this could help them eat into skys lead he said ,5
apple laptop is greatest gadget  the apple powerbook  has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc  the  laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an alltime top  list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the  zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts andor electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a selfcontained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device  in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine  in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top  is the abacus which the magazine dates at  ad and put in th place other preelectronic gadgets in the top  include the sextant from  th position the marine chronometer from  nd position and the kodak brownie camera from  th position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top  which also includes the first flash mp player diamound multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number  in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number   sonys third entry in the top  is the cdp cd player from  who can forget the crystalline hissfree blast of madonnas like a virgin emenating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elseners knife the swiss army knife from  is at number  in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone rd the nintendo gameboy th and the pulsar quartz digital watch th the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser th s toy tamagotchi th and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler th  why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pdas  laptops etc  what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for its time a technological marvel  sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it  a laptop computer is not a gadget its a working tool  the sinclair executive was the worlds first pocket calculator i think this should be there as well  how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors  are the people who created this list insane  surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker  an interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early s blessed the original noteboook pc  the tandy  the size of a paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible  whats an apple powerbook   its out of date  not much of a gadget surely it has to be something simple  timeless  the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves   it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in  a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off  all top  are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current hightech obsession than anyhting else i say this as the swiss army knife only made no   sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with a true multitakings os shame the marketing was so bad  apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else  utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition  id also put apples newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason i only wish that vulcan incs flipstart wasnt just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs  the swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget i got mine  years ago still wearing and using it a lot it stood the test of time  psion organiser series  should be up there had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge  a first i think great product innovation  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers oferr mobile pc why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site its obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that  the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices  the psion series c the first most practical way to carry all your info around  i too would back the sinclair spectrum  without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now  id have put the mobile phone high up the list probably a nokia model  sinclair spectrum  k it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and thats what i do for a living now  i wish more modern notebooks  even apples newest offerings  were more like the pb particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses theyre invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use  congratulations to apple a deserved win ,5

windows worm travels with tetris  users are being warned about a windows virus that poses as the hugely popular tetris game  the cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on pcs that it has infected while users play the game the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks the risk of infection by cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild  the cellery worm does not spread via email like many other viruses instead it browses computer networks for pcs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines when it infects a machine cellery installs a version of tetris that users can play as the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it at the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines the virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing tetris pcs running windows   me nt  and xp could be vulnerable to the worm if your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed  rather than something that should cause concern said graham cluley spokesman for antivirus firm sophos so far the number of people infected by cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low sophos urged users and companies to update their antivirus software to keep themselves protected ,5
blind student hears in colour  a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps  victor wong a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models a number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work  the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself mr wong told the bbc news website for the sake of my own study  and for the sake of blind scientists generally  i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot in order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used the software then assigns one of  piano notes to individually coloured pixels  ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldnt work that well  mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision as the notes increase in pitch i know the colours getting redder and redder and in my minds eye a patch of red appears the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images ,5
podcasters look to net money  nasa is doing it yearold boys in bedrooms are doing it couples are doing it gadget lovers  male and female  are definitely doing it  it is podcasting  diy radio in the form of downloadable mp audio files they can done by anyone who has a microphone simple software the net and something to say some liken them to talking audioblogs because many complement textbased weblogs  diarylike sites where people share their thoughts they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net on demand and the movement is at very early stages its about real people saying real things and communicating says adam curry former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting he was one of a community of people who created ipodder a small computer program known as an aggregator  it collects and automatically sends mp files to any digital musicplaying device that can play wmp formats those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like and subscribe  for free  to that shows feed when a new podcast is available it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer it is totally going to kill the business model of radio thinks curry i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are he says and they are scared to death of the next generation  like my daughter who is   who dont listen to radio they are on msn theyve got their ipod their mp player theyve got their xbox  they are not listening to radio so how are they going to reach these audiences it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it  it is a fledgling movement but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it ian fogg jupiter research analyst thinks there could be potential for business but it could take an interesting turn if big companies like apple and microsoft get involved it is a nascent area but quite exciting it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over he says  podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about  a classic hybrid it is another aspect of the timeshifting of content  the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want when and wherever you want audiences are in the s s and s rather than millions more than  podcasts are currently listed currys daily source code  which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community  has s of thousands of listeners  but dave winer is doubtful he designed the format called rss really simple syndication which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed he is also writer of the longestrunning weblog on the net scripting news he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential not in its overhyped business promise  were the sources the people doing stuff and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what were doing no matter how you look at it commercialising this medium isnt going to make very much money he says podcasting is going to be a medium of niches with audiences measured in the single digits like email or blogs maybe in a few years maybe six or seven digits but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon curry and associate ron blooms new venture called podshow is to help ordinary people produce post distribute and market their podcasts because of the way podcasts work based on rss the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are readymade targets when you look at podcasting  wow this is a pretty interesting audience the audience is preselected they have decided to subscribe to your program explains curry advertising in his eyes can be tailored to podcasts to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive how i believe this will work is to create a network that in aggregation will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters i have    listeners i could make a couple of bucks off that but not much if you are talking a million podcasters and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves then that is kind of interesting essentially he says if you are doing a bass fishing podcast someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show he is clear the ads will not be the traditional inyourface type familiar to commercial radio now we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place  it is happening already coffeeloving curry has sold  worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site  others use inshow promotions like the dawn and drew show one eric rice has won sponsorship from warner bros he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative one thing is for sure they are not about to disappear in a hurry the creative forces behind radio are elated says curry for now he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community i should be knighted for this he adds with a wry chuckle people are going to be so happy to sit at home make their podcast and make a little money ,5

row brewing over peertopeer ads  music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience  the debate over the legitimacy of filesharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertisers dream come true and a branding nightmare paul myers chief executive of wippit  a peer to peer service which provides paidfor music downloads  believes it is time advertisers stopped providing oxygen for companies that support illegal downloading you may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service edonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include nat west vodafone o first direct ntl and renault he said in an open letter to the british phonographic industry last month  he urged people to follow his lead and dump brands associated with companies such as edonkey the bpi is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks networks like edonkey kazaa and grokster facilitate illegal filesharing the bpi strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue it said in a statement illegal filesharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services we are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses it said but the issue is often more complicated for advertisers said mark mulligan a music analyst with jupiter research this has been a problem for a long time ever since the days of napster he told the bbc news website  the reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience he said if you put the legality issues aside not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience he added meanwhile companies contacted by the bbc news website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing onetel adverts were spotted on edonkey this week and its response was typical we have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge it is not our policy to advertise through peertopeer networks read a statement from the discount phone firm it has requested the advert be removed immediately said a spokeswoman similarly telecommunications firm ntl blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites since the matter was brought to its attention last month the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites a spokesman told the bbc news website  however mr mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations while smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends this is no excuse for wellknown brands he said i would be surprised if these brands didnt have the knowhow to prevent this happening he said at the moment edonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very wellknown faces advert on its network many big brands have leveraged the opportunity including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world  senator john kerry and president george w bush said chief executive sam yagan there are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network he thinks peertopeer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where theyre most comfortable at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media he said ,5
progress on new internet domains  by early  the net could have two new domain names  the post and travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the nets administrative body the names are just two of a total of  proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann the other proposed names include a domain for pornography asia mobile phones an antispam domain and one for the catalan language and culture  the post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help coordinate the ecommerce efforts of national post offices  the travel domain would be used by hotels travel firms airlines tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online it is backed by a new yorkbased trade group called the travel partnership icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a xxx domain for pornographic websites a similar proposal has been made many times in the past but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it in  icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success three of the new socalled top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as museum and aero others such as info and biz were intended to be more generic in total there are in excess of  domain names and the majority of these are for nations but domains that end in the com suffix are by far the most numerous ,5
be careful how you code  a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson  if it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them if the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs a topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computerimplemented inventions and the way it amends article  of the  european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eus ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas  in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to reenter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on oneclick online purchase it is a small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it  we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long the new proposals go back to  although argument about patentability of software and computerimplemented inventions has been going on since at least the mids they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then represented in their original form some national governments seem to be aware of the problems poland has rejected the proposal and germanys main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned  the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an a item and can only be approved or rejected no discussion or amendment is allowed so why should we be worried first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow  more directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone elses patent this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright patents are not copyright but something much stronger a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately i have never to my shame managed to read lord byrons childe harolds pilgrimage if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence the same does not hold for a patent if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then i am in trouble under patent law at least in the us coincidence is no defence the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are usbased and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or crosslicense with other patent holders  even this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer and other browsers infringed an eolas patent that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnulinux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements the damage to software will not happen overnight of course if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas and it will damage europes computer industry we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law  bill thompson is a

open source leaders slam patents  the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents  in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement mitchell kapor chairman of the mozilla foundation warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future linux is a freelyavailable alternative to microsofts windows it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made  of its patents freely available other companies are expected to follow suit  there are between  and  registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they cant afford to take them to court said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future if totally pushed to the wall  because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce softwareof course theyre going to unleash the wmds mr kapor is reported as saying microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body intellect of which it is a member as far as intellect is concerned open source and patents have coexisted for many years without problems said spokeswoman jill sutherland the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other she added ,5
musicians upbeat about the net  musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music a survey has found  the study by us researchers pew internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against filesharing while most considered filesharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders even successful artists dont think the lawsuits will benefit musicians said report author mary madden  for part of the study pew internet conducted an online survey of  musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april   they ranged from fulltime successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music we looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry ms madden told the bbc news website we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of  going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web more than  offered free samples online while twothirds sold their music via the net independent musicians in particular saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically said ms madden they are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright  perhaps surprisingly opinions about online filesharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry  through the recording industry association of america riaa it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us it found that most artists saw filesharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing said one musician quoted by the report its hard to keep making records if they dont pay for themselves through sales however  said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters many suggested that rather than fighting filesharing the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy said ms madden ,5

losing yourself in online gaming  online role playing games are timeconsuming but enthralling flights from reality but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously  when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight  and to offer a warning an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair  keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texas some of the comments were humorous this game is so good im not going to get it theres no way i could limit the hours id spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from england  but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpg shame they are getting more popular as you know this problem is just going to mushroom wrote stuart stantondavies in huddersfield scaremongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices  gaming is like any other pastime  it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetry  unfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make however stories about gamers spending  to  hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some  massively multiplayer online role playing games  mmorpgs  allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds the scope of these games  like warcraft everquest ultima among others  is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinite part of the problem is grinding  by which gamers have to perform longwinded mindless tasks to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure such openendedness brings with it a desire to keep playing not for no reason is everquest eq nicknamed evercrack e hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently i used to play the online roleplaying game everquest a lot by a lot i mean probably  to  hours a week on average and on weeks where i didnt have to work as many as  or  hours  he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasnt that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much you lie you dont go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv a good thing presumably he wrote explaining how everquest took over his time he quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquest  let us be clear  such obsession is rare but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far almost  people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month only a fraction will descend into obsessives the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind jane who runs the website compiles a chronicle of heartrending stories i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than some people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she said one unnamed correspondent  all are anonymous  wrote on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me  i cant talk to him while he is playing there is absolutely no point as he doesnt hear me or is so distracted that i get a ummm ya a few minutes after i ask him a question  gaming widows has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers but for some it is not in the least funny another correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness and some of them are even sadder today our son was five days old the sad truth is my husband spent  hours today playing his warcraft game he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream and games ever more immersive there will be no hiding place for social problems    i wish  hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isnt an  hour stretch isnt that surprising  ive known people to play  hours at a stretch i know of people who are spending their weeks holiday from work playing warcraft i know of people who would play evercrack in shiftswaking at am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they needed to appear i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life by all standards many of us are addicts so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playingor do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting  sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them i have been in a long term relationship for over  years  since that began games have become more and more complex and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time  i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct i play games a lot definately over  hours a week but i dont go missing work or other commitments in order to play games  i have about a year ago deleted every game on my computer rpgs are the worst  the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword unlike books or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing when you stop playing youre at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your  hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since youve gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one  despite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality  my advice to gaming widows is if you cant beat em join em that is try playing it yourself if he wants to play as well well at least youll be together somewhere  i was an addict and it cost me my relationship i still play now but without the guilt  hehe how long have i played in one sitting from morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink now thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate  obsessive behaviour is of course always cause for concern but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality obviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem this problem however has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be real any more than  for example  an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human if mmorpgs have a unique danger in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world but rather that they can be easily accessed  the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern  hour culture  the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them theres always another quest to do a few of my friends have only had about  hours sleep since it was released friday  championship manager consumed my life for years one particular session started at about pm on a sunday paused for a brief sleep at am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another  hour session the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that  i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did others were less fortunate and dropped out of college now that i am holding a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague  when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from am till pm when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well hence justifying playing it all evening i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job  when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so im trying not to spend so much time on there its not easy i feel as if ive got a real addiction going on here  for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal once it is completed that is it i am finished time to move on i become obsessed to complete the goal so from that standpoint it is an addiction in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pit it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times  in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world pretty scary implications if you think about it  i cant buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it  i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level im sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor slowly building up my character stopping only for food and toilet breaks thankfully i made a clean break and actually managed to sell my jedi account for   which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum  seven years ago i began playing ultima online this game dominated  years of my life they were  wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv  gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogres but somehow i found time to get out even met someone and got married has my life changed hell no i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning on with the fun  online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates  many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families relationships and good careers a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs the message to the government is clear either legalise drugs or outlaw online gaming  sounds like there are some sad stories here  and i can believe them all i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it is i am resolute that it will not take over my life it certainly gets in the way though i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it  i think im obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest  and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to im always thinking in the back if my mind that id rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united  i am obsessed with online role playing games its not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation  goals to achieve etc i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning  as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits such as being a couch potato the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature  these games are like most things  too much of anything is a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun  living in korea at the moment they have lots pc bangs internet cafes nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games  i play xbox live every day i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix the longest i played was a  hour straight session i know i play for to long but its an obsession that i cant control can you reccomend a counsellor  this is not a wind up but something im increasingly concerned with  me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day were both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual its getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying real life  i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out the longest period i played was  hrs straight i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version couldnt help myself in future im going to regulate my time far more strictly great game  having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into  unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a persons health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse  these people are pathetic they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and online universe absolutely meaningless  hours when i was a kid at school and i was on half term,5

intel unveils laser breakthrough  intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light  scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade  weve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intels photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia  and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang  show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it  telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these lightmoving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in highvolume manufacturing have been solved were trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easytomake filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semiconductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses its a technical validation that it can work he said ,5
itunes user sues apple over ipod  a user of apples itunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an ipod to play songs  he says apple is breaking anticompetition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site apple which opened its online store in  after launching the ipod in  uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the ipod californian thomas slattery filed the suit in the us district court in san jose and is seeking damages  apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice the lawsuit states the key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like itunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market according to ernest gellhorn an antitrust law professor at george mason university as a practical matter the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims prof gellhorn said apple has sold more than six million ipods since the gadget was launched and has an  share of the market for portable digital music players market research firm npd group has reported  more than  million songs have been sold by the itunes music store since it was launched apple has unlawfully bundled tied andor leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players and viceversa the lawsuit said mr slattery called himself an itunes customer who was also forced to purchase an apple ipod if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to a spokesman for apple declined to comment apples online music store uses a different format for songs than napster musicmatch realplayer and others the rivals use the mp format or microsofts wma format while apple uses aac which it says helps thwart piracy the wma format also includes socalled digital rights management which is used to block piracy ,5
net regulation still possible  the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said  content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tvquality video online becomes a norm at a debate in westminster the net industry considered the options lord currie chairman of superregulator ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option at the debate organised by the internet service providers association ispa lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation  the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or selfregulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion  some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of  and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb itv and the bbc head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms how risque can i be in this new age with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely i can push it to the limit he said  in fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in  this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several highprofile legal cases richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible huge changes are afoot in  he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net the bbcs planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said  one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said mr ayers as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign if content is ondemand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it there is no watershed on the net said mr burke ,5
smartphones suffer skulls attack  owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper  those downloading the software could find all the icons on their  phone swapped for images of skulls when installed the malicious program also locks many of the s functions making it hard to use and harder to repair the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones  the file nicknamed skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free addons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the  phone the skulls program is labelled as a file called extendedthememanagerzip  once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with nonworking versions so the phone becomes almost useless the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring a security warning symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself despite this finnish antivirus lab fsecure said it had sporadic reports of  owners being caught out by it the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee symbian phones produced by sony ericsson motorola benq arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program ,5

games enter the classroom  video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom  with violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving said martin owen at futurelab mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error  futurelab is a nonprofit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpoolbased games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market learning games were somewhat oldfashioned and we didnt see anyone else doing what we wanted to do said dr carl gavin managing director of lateral visions the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element the result is racing academy a massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well  it is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational said mr owen players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs before and after racing teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks mr owen  the game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other said ben williamson a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the childrens desire to rise to a challenge games in the classroom need to support the teacher it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge he said professor angela macfarlane based at bristol university has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms  use of games in schools has been patchy she found with sim city proving the most popular traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used socalled edutainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research it is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies she wrote in a paper entitled games and learning lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles  persuading developers to write for the educational market this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing already there are games on the market such as civilisation and age of empire that have educational elements said mr owen even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people he said it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though ,5
us woman sues over ink cartridges  a us woman is suing hewlett packard hp saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date  the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs refilling even when it does not the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february  hp the worlds biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change  but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a builtin expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said the lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last  months the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as  but it could cost up to  in running costs over an month period due to cartridge a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uks office of fair trading oft which concluded in a  report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers ,5

a decade of good website design  the web looks very different today than it did  years ago  back in  yahoo had only just launched most websites were textbased and amazon google and ebay had yet to appear but says usability guru dr jakob nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the  core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today roughly  of the things we found  years ago are still an issue today he said some have gone away because users have changed and  have changed because technology has changed  some design crimes such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said dr nielsen  but theres great stability on usability concerns he told the bbc news website dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a sites total design were as important as ever its necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such he said they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off he said but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband  dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google amazon ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful said dr nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net  all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet he said they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user none of them have a fancy or glamorous look he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied in the future dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online they are becoming like the operating system to the internet he said but he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better currently he said search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use  terms in  only  words were used i think its amazing that we have seen a doubling in a year period of those search terms said dr nielsen  you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme go digital ,5

europe backs digital tv lifestyle  how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious european project  in nice last week the european commission announced its networked  electronic media nem initiative its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme more than  experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia intel philips alcatel france telecom thomson and telefonica it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together but again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible standalone solutions working a longterm strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required  the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget this is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management drm schemes currently drm solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the worlds dominant drm scheme is huge although entertainment is an obvious first step it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare energy efficiency and control of the smart home the year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years  simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media ,5
how to make a greener computer  the hitech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware bill thompson thinks its about time  my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge now you cant buy petrol with lead additives and were all better off as a result chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways  apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic mercury cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops mobiles and music players  one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive a welldesigned electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling  they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears it is as they say about time we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage the car engine is a case in point lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder a phenomenon called knocking so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work so it took decades before it was done were seeing the same thing in the technology industry and as a result there are billions of devices from old mobile phones to antique handhelds that will have to be recycled in years to come if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc keeping the monitor and other peripherals  even if apple does not get its way four or fiveyearold computers are not good enough to run modern programs and its not unreasonable to replace them but what do we do with the old ones  ive just looked around my office and i find two monitors an old  pc two old handhelds three ancient laptops four antique mobile phones a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use they are all old enough to be hazardous waste  the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead  but its possible that some of the components could be useful i could take them up the to the council recycling centre but its a mile drive away across town and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste a box for glass cans and paper that can be recycled and a black bin for the rest there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too id probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box  at least eventually  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital ,5

blogger grounded by her airline  a us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary  queen of the sky otherwise known as ellen simonetti evolved into an anonymous semifictional account of life in the sky but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of inappropriate images delta airlines declined to comment  i was really shocked i had no warning ms simonetti told bbc news online i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog i thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites ms simonetti was suspended on  september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past  ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mothers death she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies the airlines name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to ms simonetti  the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother we often take pictures on flight or on layovers i just though why not include them on my blog for fun i never meant it as something to harm my company and dont understand how they think it did harm them ms simonetti said she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web of the  or so images on the site only one showed ms simonettis flight wings they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up she said the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended as far as ms simonetti knows there is no company antiblogging policy there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear  jeffrey matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers he said it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy you have to remember that as an employee you dont have total free speech anymore he said mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they employees do cross the line he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line he said ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken if they had asked me just take down the blog i would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option she said this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it if i had known it would cost me my job i would not have done that ,5
web radio takes spanish rap global  spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanishlanguage music but what you will not find is much spanishlanguage hiphop  hiphop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanishspeaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad but now a us company is bringing rap and hiphop en espanol to computer users everywhere los caballeros de plan g are one of mexicos hottest hiphop acts they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey but most mexican hiphop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanishspeaking world rarely get a chance to hear the groups tracks on the radio  you cant really just go on the radio and listen to hiphop in spanish its just not accessible says manuel millan a native of san diego california its really hard for the spanish hiphop scene to get into mainstream radio you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world millan and two friends set out to change that  they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally  mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible so millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradiocom the name says it all it is webbased radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hiphop tracks the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate all the user has to do is download a media player there are no djs it is just music streamed over the net for free suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan g are producing export quality rap  the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hiphop right now the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage but the production values are improving and artists such as argentinas mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradiocom hes considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hiphop scene millan says he really hasnt had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but hes definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanishspeaking world currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradiocoms top  as is cuban artist papo record every countrys got its own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says latinohiphopradiocom has been up and running for a couple of months now the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world right now mexico leads the way accounting for about  of listeners but web surfers in spain are logging in as well  about  of the web stations traffic comes from there that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanishlanguage rap and hiphop millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hiphop production that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences  but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradiocoms top  his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hiphop leader in spain on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against  emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact its basically him bragging that hes one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says and its pretty much true he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable its amazing latinohiphopradiocom is hoping to expand in the coming year millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hiphop and rap  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbhboston coproduction ,5

mobile multimedia slow to catch on  there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular  consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a  increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of  according to analysts gartner more than  million handsets were sold globally between july and september  a period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so  in fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing figures gathered by continental research shows that  of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message mms up from  in  this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to  million getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets  also he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to according to continental research  of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation only  regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to peoples reluctance to start sending them said mr jain they ask themselves if im streaming video from one handset to another will it work he said theres a lot of user apprehension about that  there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users  noone wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wappush to get multimedia to their customers but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india the largest mobile firm in the country the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems while not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content as a result  of the subscribers to the hutch alive which uses cellticks broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said yaron toren spokesman for celltick until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting through ,5

looks and music to drive mobiles  mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner  more than  million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date the figure was  more than in  and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in  said analysts although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slowdown in replacement sales  all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years time they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones  but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner third generation mobiles g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who dont really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms  more likely to drive sales in  would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services the motorola razr v phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in  she added this was not a womens thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of selfexpression too it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi  people are after something that is nicelooking and together with that there is the entertainment side this year music will have a part to play in this the market for fulltrack music downloads was worth just  million  million in  but is set to be worth  billion  million by  according to jupiter research sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w which combines a digital music player with up to  hours battery life and a two megapixel camera in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones apple said the new itunes music player would become motorolas standard music application for its music phones but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life ,5
friends fear with lost mobiles  people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends  more than  of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years more than half  of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book a fifth rely entirely on mobiles about  of uk adults own at least one mobile according to official figures it is estimated that  of over s own a mobile according to intervoice but the figures are higher for those aged between  and   most  to yearolds  and  to yearolds  own at least one nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts information again if the phone was lost stolen or replaced  the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book many mobile owners do not bother to make backups of their contact details and with people changing their phones once a year on average it becomes a problem they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart relying on the mobile phone book instead were a nation of lazy soandsos david noone from intervoice said we put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly cant be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart one in three women the survey said thought if they lost their phones it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether most  said they had no idea what their partners number was mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide backup services on the network itself instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves  generally information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software sim backup devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds  but some operators offer customers free webbased backup services too orange told the bbc news website that those with orange smartphones could use the my phone syncing service which means backups of address books and other data are created online for nonsmartphone users a memory mate card could be used to back up data on the phone o also offers a free webbased syncing service which works over gprs and gsm neither vodafone or tmobile currently offer a free network service for backups but encourage people to use sim backup devices it is thought that about  phones are lost or stolen every month and  of total street crime involves a mobile mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year globally more than  million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of   more than the previous year according to analysts it is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of  ,5
lifestyle governs mobile choice  faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests  instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an indepth study by telecommunications company ericsson historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericssons consumer and enterprise lab we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website  for the study ericsson interviewed  mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone peoples habits remain the same said dr bjorn they just move the activity into the mobile phone as its a much more convenient way to do it  one good example of this was diarywriting among younger people he said while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone  especially one equipped with a camera  helps them keep it in a different form youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles ericssons research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists only when about  of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it  once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop however he said now  of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month in  the figure was  similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise in  only  of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month now the figure is  similar rises have been seen in many other european nations dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life ,5
speech takes on search engines  a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results  called speegle it has the look and feel of a normal search engine with the added feature of being able to read out the results scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments  the edinburghbased firm cec has married speech technology with everpopular internet search the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web  according to search engine ask jeeves around  of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad said speegle founder gordon renton the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people although the royal national institute of the blind rnib is looking at the technology he added but julie howell digital policy manager at the rnib expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind peoples experience of the web there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be she said blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way she added  the site uses a technology dubbed panavox which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dialup connections visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known if silent search engine google google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments said mr renton it is not a ripoff we are doing something that google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery he said speegle is proving popular with those learning english in countries such as japan and china the site is bombarded by people just listening to the words the repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots said mr renton ,5
more women turn to net security  older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks according to a twoyear study  the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus spam and spyware attacks rose by  each year between  and  the study for net security firm preventon shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers it is thought that  of those buying home net security programs are retired for the last three years that has gone up by an average of  but more retired women  were buying security software than retired men the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that highspeed broadband net connections can pose to surfers  the study predicts that  of all home pc net security buyers will be women in  they could even overtake men as the main buyers by  if current rates persist according to the research i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong said one over woman who took part in the research  you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last  years paul goosens head of preventon told the bbc news website now we are seeing real people  both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online particuarly if they are new to broadband he said  programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dialup users with a slower connection too said mr goosens security software should be easy to use with simple interfaces and instructions written in nontechnical language he added the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about email viruses highprofile complaints about rogue diallers and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of antivirus firewall and spywareremoval programs too without protection these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally  more than  pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses a study from security from symantec showed last year viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer according to net security experts programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs many based in eastern europe over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because said mr goosens they are reported in the press much more you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat they are asking the right questions he explained it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider that they are safe to connect to the net an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes by the end of the year it is thought that more than  of uk homes will have broadband net access in july last year the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dialup for the first time according to the office of national statistics ,5

latest opera browser gets vocal  net browser opera  due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors  the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud the voice features based on ibm technology are currently only available in the windows version opera can also magnify text by up to  times and users can create style sheets its developers say this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users  another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling  the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people our idea was to take a first step in making humancomputer interaction more natural said ms hanson people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard so this makes the web a more handsfree experience unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice around  voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone the voice recognition function is currently only available in english opera is free to download but a paidfor version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support opera began life as a research project  a spinoff from norwegian telecoms company telenor its browser is used by an estimated  million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms ,5
how to make a gigapixel picture  the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands  the finished image is  billion pixels in size  making it about  times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras the huge image of delft was created by stitching together  single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot if printed out in standard  dots per inch resolution the picture would be m high and m long  the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail the website is already proving popular and currently has more than  visitors every day  the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the  gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge  the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november  that image portrayed bryce canyon national park in utah and was made up of  separate photographs the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons image he did it all by hand which was an enormous effort and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques it would be feasible to build a larger image said jurgen den hartog one of the tno researchers behind the project we were not competing with mr lyons but it started as a lunchtime bet  the dutch team used already available technologies although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the highresolution image  we had to rewrite almost all the tools me den hartog told the bbc news website all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image so we had to develop one ourselves the  component pictures were taken on july  by a computercontrolled camera with a  mm lens each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days following the success of this project and with promises of help from others the tno team is considering creating a full degree panoramic view of another dutch city with even higher resolution ,5
california sets fines for spyware  the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california  from  january a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware the legislation which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information at its worst it has the ability to hijack personal data like passwords login details and credit card numbers the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate  one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer users websurfing it can result in people being bombarded with popup ads that are hard to close in washington congress has been debating four antispyware bills but california is a step ahead the states consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware consumers are able to seek up to  in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that  of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring  separate spyware programs currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and adaware ,5
peertopeer nets here to stay  peertopeer pp networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts  once several highprofile legal cases against filesharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from pp technology the expert panel probed the future of pp at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january the first convictions for pp piracy were handed out in the us in january william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software since the first successful filesharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of pp technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy but that is going to change very soon according to the panel  the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate pp networks  which are not illegal in themselves  and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks but they have slowly realised that pp is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of pp network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copyprotection standards  but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with pp cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media when they cant stop it they try to control it then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business in august  the san franciscobased us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two filesharing networks the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the s vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal  pp networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files instead it uses direct connections between computers  or clients there are now many different types of pp systems than work in different ways pp nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use pp technology to distribute them the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many the global entertainment industry says more than  billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure filesharers away from free content sales of legallydownloaded songs grew tenfold in  with  million tracks bought online in the us and europe in  months the ifpi reported this week but such download services are very different from pp networks not least because of the financial aspect  there are several moneyspinning models that could turn pp into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies paidforpassalong in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiserbased options are all being considered we see there are going to be different models for commoditising pp said marc morgenstern vice president of antipiracy firm overpeer  consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industrys potential controlling grip on content and pp technology by continuing to use it for their own creations unsigned bands for example use pp networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign increasingly what you are seeing on pp is consumercreated content said derek broes from microsoft they will probably pay an increasing role in helping pp spread he said looking into pps future file sharing is just the beginning for pp networks as far as mr broes is concerned once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said filesharing is the tip of the iceberg ,5
firefox browser takes on microsoft  microsofts internet explorer has a serious rival in the longawaited firefox  web browser which has just been released  few people get excited when some new software is released especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of prelaunch fervour fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version  of the browser is available the release of firefox  on  november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giants internet explorer browser  firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in  much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february earlier incarnations but which had the same core technology were called phoenix and firebird since then the software has been gaining praise and converts not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsofts internet explorer rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability  internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie before july this year according to websidestory internet explorer was used by about  of web surfers that figure had remained static for years in july the ie using population dropped to  and by the end of october stood at  the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner  of the windows using netbrowsing population firefox is proving popular because at the moment it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsofts program for instance firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them it blocks popups has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed  one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras or extensions produced for it the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program this has resulted in many different addons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels firefox which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix also has a growing number of vocal netbased fans a campaign coordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the  needed for a full page advert in the new york times the campaign set itself a target of recruiting  volunteers ten days in to the campaign  people had signed up and now about  has been raised the ad is due to run sometime in a threeweek period in late novemberearly december the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ies hold on the web using population from alternative browsers such as opera safari amaya and even netscape ,5
